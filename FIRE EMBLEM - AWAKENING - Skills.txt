You can use Ctrl+F as a shortcut to simplify your search. It's really useful,
specially since this guide covers many different things.

For example, typing "C-" in the search bar will lead you to "Inheritance".
In another example, typing "3-" will lead you to "Aether". You can also use the
section's name, or just scroll down until you find what you are looking for.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Hello, and welcome to my Skill FAQ for Fire Emblem Awakening! Here, we are
going to analyse each of the 94 Skills, from what they do to who learns them.
This will help you understand how each skill works, and what skills are good
choices for your characters.

This FAQ will also explain somethings about Class and Skill inheritance, since
they are important things to know when planning your Skills. And we will also
give you tips on how to build Skillsets for different roles.

This FAQ is the result of my daily topic series called "Rate the Skill", where
me and many other people would discuss about Skills and rate them based on many
factors, like usefulness and availiability.

You can find all the entries by searching for "Rate the Skill" in the Board.

I hope you will enjoy this FAQ as much as I did writing it and my series both.
But be warned, this contains SPOILERS in many different levels. Proceed with
caution.

                             B- What are Skills?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Skills are special abilities that the Characters can learn in this game. They
have many different purposes, from dealing damage to healing, from increasing a
Stat to increasing Accuracy, and much more.

Each character can bring up to 5 Skills to battle, but they can learn more and
switch between them before the battle.

There are 4 ways to learn Skills.

-Leveling-

All Classes outside of Conqueror and Lodestar, have two Skills that characters
can learn when they reach a certain level. But, this depends on what kind of
class it is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Classes, like Mercenary, Mage,  Fighter and Lord, will teach
the character one Skill at Level 1, and another at Level 10.

Advanced Classes, like Great Knight, Swordmaster, War Monk and Trickster, will
teach one Skill at level 5 and another at level 15.

Special Classes, like Villager, Dancer, Taguel and Manakete, will teach on
Skill at level 1 and  another at level 15.

Other names for Basic Classes that are used: 1st tier or Unpromoted Classes
Other names for Advanced Classes that are used: 2nd tier of Promoted Classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Skill Manuals-

Fire Emblem Awakening supports DLC (Downloadable Content), and some Skills can
only be obtained through DLC. Beating a specific DLC map will award you with a
Skill Manual. You can use it to teach a Skill to any character, regardless of
level, gender or Class. You can aquire more by beating that DLC again.

-Inheritance-

All of the second generation characters, like Lucina, can inherit Skills from
their parents. This is a very important subject, so much that it deserves a
section for itself.

-Special Cases-

Sometimes, a character has no access to a Class, or there is no Class that
teaches the Skill... and they have it anyway. There are 4 cases where this
happens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Walhart has Conquest (Skill 85), but no Class can learn it. In this case,
maybe it was a Skill from the Conqueror Class, but he starts at a high level
and the Class is exclusive to him, so we can't know.

*Aversa has Shadowgift (Skill 86), but no Class learns it.

*Emmeryn starts with Magic +2 and Focus (Skills 59 and 60), but cannot reclass
to Mage. I suspect that this was an error, since her Weapon Ranks and the whole
motiff of her Paralogue would suggest that she was a Sage that promoted from
Cleric. She can still reclass to Cleric, though.

*Priam starts with Lancebreaker, Swordbreaker and Luna (Skills 52, 50 and 27),
but he has no acess to the classes that teach those skills (Griffon Rider,
Wyvern Lord and Great Knight respectively).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Weapons-

This isn't a "learning method", but it's worth mentioning. There are certain
weapons that allow the users to have a certain skill. Sometimes they are named
after the Skill, but sometimes they aren't. They will only grant the skill if
they are currently equipped.

When you are using a Skill through a weapon, having the actual Skill equipped
won't give you any additional effects. For example, having someone with the
Astra (Skill 15) equipped with the Astra Bow won't result in a doubled Trigger
Rate or more damage. Those weapons are very rare, so use them wisely.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               C- Inheritance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skill Inheritance is an important aspect of building the Skillset of Lucina and
the other child characters. It may look complicated, but it's really simple.

All of the second generation characters will inherit the last Skill from both
parents' Skillsets. This is set from the moment you start the chapter where you
can recruit them, but the game never saves it, so you can exit the chapter and
return later with other Skills.

There are a few exceptions to those Skill Inheritance rules:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Chrom will ALWAYS pass Aether (Skill 3) to his possible daughters, and
Rightful King (Skill 4) to his possible sons.

*Lucina will ALWAYS pass Aether (Skill 3).

*Aversa will ALWAYS pass Shadowgift (Skill 86).

*Walhart will ALWAYS pass Conquest (Skill 85).

*DLC Skills (Skills 87-94) cannot be inherited, and the game will look for
another viable skill to pass.

*If the last Skill of a parent is one that the kid already starts out with, it
will be ignored, and the game will look for another viable skill to pass.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parents not only pass Skills, but all of their other classes will be passed.
However, some classes are exclusive to certain genders, and will be changed to
an appropriate class if the child is of a different gender than the parent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Vaike's Fighter and Barbarian classes will turn into Knight and Mercenary.

*Gaius's Fighter Class will turn into Pegasus Knight.

*Donnel's Villager and Fighter classes will turn into Pegasus Knight and
Toubadour.

*Gregor's Barbarian Class will turn into Troubadour.

*Henry's Barbarian Class will turn into Troubadour.

*Walhart does not pass Conqueror. It does not turn into anything.

*Lissa's Pegasus Knight and Troubadour Classes will turn into Myrmidon and
Barbarian.

*Miriel's Troubadour Class will turn into Barbarian.

*Mariabelle's Pegasus Knight and Troubadour Classes will turn into Priest and
Cavalier.

*Olivia's Pegasus Knight Class will turn into and Barbarian. She simply doesn't
pass Dancer to Lucina or Morgan, while Inigo somehow starts as a Mercenary for
some reason.

*Cherche's Troubadour Class will turn into Fighter.

*Even though it's not gender exclusive, Panne's Wyvern Rider Class will turn
into Barbarian.

*Sully has no access to the Knight Class, but Kjelle stats out as one anyway.

*Chrom does not pass Lord to other kids, but Lucina starts out as one. She also
cannot pass it.

*Male Avatar and Female Avatar will exchange Fighter/Barbarian and Pegasus
Knight/Troubadour, depending on the gender.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't worry about this all at once! You will have time to sit down and plan
everything. Well, we are here to talk about Skills, right? So how do you choose
what Skills to pass?


If both the parent and child are of the same gender, this means that there's
nothing that they can pass that the kid can't get alone. Thus, we choose what's
more convenient: a Skill that you don't want to make the kid grind for. A basic
Class gets experience faster than a promoted one, so the latter's Skills have
higher priority.

But, if they aren't of the same gender, this means that some classes are not
inherited, but the kid will get another one that's more appropriate for their
gender. Thus, the parents will be able to learn Skills that the kids CANNOT get
by themselves, so you should pass one of those gender-exclusive Skills. If you
don't have the child's future Skillset planned, it's better to have more Skills
to work with, even if you pass something you will eventually don't use anymore.
But, when you have the child's Skillset planned, you can opt to, again, pass a
Skill you don't want them to grind for.


Here, we will talk about the best Skills to pass when a the kid is of another
gender than the parent.

When talking about a mother's Skill, the first thing to do is see if she has
access to Pegasus Knight. If yes, you MUST pass Galeforce (Skill 38). This
applies to Lissa, Mariabelle, Olivia, and Female Avatar and is extremely
important.

Miriel can pass a Skill from Troubadour, meaning you have 2 options: Renewal
or Dual Support+ (Skills 72 and 76). If her husband has access to Priest, then
Laurent can get Renewal by himself.

Cherche is in a similar situation, but Gerome can reclass to Priest... making
Dual Support+ the only choice. If you don't have access to DLC, though, you
could also pass Resistance +2 (Skill 73) to fix both mother and son's issues
with the stat, somewhat.

Panne should pass a Skill from Wyvern Rider, if her husband doesn't have it
too. Yarne works best as a support and Axe user, meaning he will miss a lot
against agile classes, specially those with Swords. Thus, the best choice for
him is Swordbreaker (Skill 50). He will always retain his beast weakness, so,
if you are worried about Beast Killers, you can choose Lancebreaker (Skill 52)
instead.


Now, when talking about fathers, the first thing of note is if they can pass
Pegasus Knight (converted), so the daughters can grind for Galeforce. This
applies to Gaius, Donnel and Male Avatar. Kjelle, Noire and Nah cannot have
Galeforce by themselves, so they need one of them as their dad. While there are
other fathers that also give good options for each, you should keep this in
mind.

Male Avatar, Gregor and Vaike always pass Mercenary, thus, Sol (Skill 11) is
available to daughters normally. This means you need to choose between Wrath
and Counter (Skills 42 and 45). Henry doesn't give Mercenary, but the choice
is still between Counter and Wrath.

Gaius should always pass Sol, unless his daughter is Severa. In her case, pass
Counter. A similar logic can be applied to Donnel, but he also has Aptitude
(Skill 81) to consider. but if you plan on grinding, ignore Aptitude.


Those are the most important things to know about inheritance. I mentioned
Classes many times, but they are important aspects of building a good skillset,
so you should be aware of everything I just explained. It's quite a lot of
information, and I know it looks like a monster, but give it time and you will
understand everything perfectly. T'was pretty overwhelming for me at first too.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  D- Skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we begin, here's how this FAQ will handle each Skill:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#- Name of the Skill. (Class that learns the Skill,and the Level required).
Rank: (The overall rating on the Skill, as decided during my series by the
community.)
Classification: (What kind of Skill it is. Sometimes there are more than one.)

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: (What characters have the Skill when they join.)
*Who learns this Skill: (What characters can naturally learn the Skill.)
*Who inherits this Skill: (Kids that require Class or Skill Inheritance.)
Max: (the maximun number of kids that can have this skill inherited.)
*Weapons that grant this skill: (If any.)
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: (If any.)

Description: (Their In-game Description.)

Analysis: (My comments and the community's thoughs about the Skill, how it can
be good for you, and special setups that work well with it, if there are any
worth mentioning. Sometimes a better explanation of what the skill does, if the
description is lacking or misleading.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I briefly explained above what each thing means, but we will go for a more
in-depth explanation here. First, here are what the ratings mean:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*D Rank:
Barely useful, should be swapped with another Skill as soon as possible most
of the time.

*C Rank:
Not the most useful Skill, but it still does something good enough for you to
keep it for a while, or even bring it on your final Skillset if you want. But,
they generally should be taken out when you can.

*B Rank:
Useful, may be a bit situational, or requires other skills to truly shine...
but it does a good job and can be kept with no problems.

*A Rank:
Very useful, will always be a great help to you, and is very reliable. It is
a worthy addition to most skillsets.

*S Rank:
The absolute best skills. They break the game in half most of the time, and
should be your highest priority when making a skillset.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we have the possible Skill classifications that will be used. They show us
how the Skill works and/or what it does in a general way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Partner Skills:
Affects Pair-up and Dual bonuses/effects.

*Area Buffer Skills:
Gives a boost to allies within a certain area for every turn.

*Offensive Skills:
Increases damage output when a condition is met.

*Trigger Skills:
They have a chance of triggering, based on a stat. They are refered as Proc
Skills or Offensive Trigger Skills when they activate during your attack in
a battle.

*Internal Booster Skills:
Gives a special boost to something that you can't see.

*Rally Skills:
Give allies within 3 spaces a boost for one turn. All Rally Skills are Area
Buffer Skills and External Booster Skills by default.

*Support Skills:
Have varied, unique effects, so they don't go anywhere else. In some cases,
they might have another classification, related to how it is Triggered.

*Accuracy Skills:
Increase Hit and Avoid Rates for the user, and only the user. Usually the
actual bonus is only seen in the combat forecast and battles, not in the
touch screen's statistics.

*Healing Skills:
Restores HP upon activation.

*Weaponbreaker Skills:
Gives a big Hit/Avoid Rate bonus depending on the enemy's weapon. All of those
Skills will be Accuracy Skills by default.

*Crisis Skills:
Will always activate, but only when the user has 50% or less HP, rounded down.

*Weaponfaire Skills:
Increase Attack by 5 when equipped with a certain weapon. All Weaponfaire
Skills are Offensive Skills by default.

*Movement Skills:
Increase the user's Movement range if certain conditions are met.

*Defensive Skills:
Decrease damage taken from specific sources.

*External Booster Skills:
Gives a visible boost to a stat.

*Isolation Skills:
Will only work when no units of a certain affiliation are within 3 spaces.
Pair-up parters don't count.

*Killing Skills:
Require you to defeat an enemy for it to activate.

*Critical Skills:
Directly increases Critical Hit Rate.

*Area Debuffer Skills:
Gives a Hit and/or Avoid Rate penalty to enemies within a certain area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And, in regards to the users:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Morgan's starting class changes according to Avatar's spouse, so their
starting Skills will change too. Morgan starts as a Level 10 unit, so they
will start with 2 skills most of the time. I will only mention the parent
required if they don't start with the skill. All others that do start with the
skill will make Morgan start with it too.


*Those who can "learn" the skill, require level ups or reclasing to do so. For
kids, this covers their reclassing option inherited from their default parent
only.


*Those who can "inherit" the skill, are the kids who can't learn the skill,
unless their parents pass the skill or the Class to them. Since the parents
who can pass the skill are already listed, you won't see a mention of what
parents can pass the skill, unless there is a conversion of Class dues to
gender.

Thanks to the possibility of all kids being the Avatar's, they can inherit
many classes, so usually this section will mention ALL of the remaining kids,
unless we are talking about a skill that's gender-locked. Some kids can't get
some of those Skills.

And for the sake of convenience, I'll give the max number of units that can
inherit the Skill.


*Spotpass and DLC characters have the same reclassing options as the Avatar.
Since there are over 100 characters, I will only mention those that have a
special skill that an Avatar of the same gender wouldn't be able to learn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, without further ado, let's begin!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- Dual Strike+ (Lord, Level 1).
Rank: B
Classification: Partner Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Chrom, Lucina.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Roy, DLC Catria, Prince
Marth.

Description:
Increases the Trigger Rate of Dual Strikes by 10%.

Analysis:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dual Strike's Trigger Rate formula is = (Lead Unit's Skill stat +
Support Unit's Skill stat)/4 + Support bonus). This bonus is 20 if neither unit
has a suport level, and increases by 10 for each rank (leading to a maximum
bonus of 60 for S ranked pairs).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to the Support bonus being a huge part of the Trigger Rate, you won't
see many Dual Strikes early on, and they will be commonplace later on.

That being said, in harder difficulities, the earlygame chapters are the
toughest, so a Dual Strike can be a gift from heaven... while in the hardest
lategame chapters, you rely too much on them, so those bonuses can still be
very important to make sure they will happen.

Dual attacks are, nonetheless, very useful in almost all situations, in all
difficulties. However, it's hindered by the low number of users.

It's worth noting that this Skill will be active regardless of the unit being
the lead or the support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2- Charm (Lord, Level 10).
Rank: D
Classification: Area Buffer Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Lucina.
*Who can learn this Skill: Chrom.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Marth, DLC Seliph,
DLC Elincia, DLC Eldigan, Pr. Marth, Minerva, Raquesis, Seliph, Nanna.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +5 to allies within 3 spaces.

Analysis: While this covers a decent area... the bonuses are too small, and
probably won't make a difference to anyone. Being limited to two people is not
good for this Skill either.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3- Aether (Great Lord, Level 5).
Rank: A
Classification: Offensive Skill, Healing Skill and Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Lucina.
*Who can learn this Skill: Chrom.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Kjelle, Cynthia, Female Morgan.
Max = 2.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Ike, Ike.

Description: Use Sol and Luna in succession. Trigger % = (Skill Stat/2).

Analysis: Sol and Luna (Skills 11 and 27) will Trigger individually, so you get
two hits in a single attack, and both can be Critical Hits. It's damage output
is generally very high, and healing is always a plus.

This skill, however, is hindered by it's low Trigger Rate. Chrom and Lucina can
make this skill reliable through Rightful King (Skill 4), but Lucina's sister
or daughter will have no such luck, and are better off with other ways to deal
damage and heal

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4- Rightful King (Great Lord, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Internal Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Chrom, Lucina.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Inigo, Brady, Male Morgan.
Max = 2.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Celica, Ephrain, King
Marth.

Description: Increases the Trigger Rate of the unit's Skills by 10%.

Analysis: As mentioned above, this Skill is what makes Aether broken for the
Lords, but unlike Aether, it's other users can make it shine in other ways.

It will make all skills that this FAQ classifies as "Trigger Skills" much more
useful, as Skills with low Trigger Rates can be much more reliable, while the
other Skills with higher Trigger Rates can also be much more dependable than
before, making this a solid choice for all of it's potential users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5- Veteran (Tactician, Level 1).
Rank: A
Classification: Internal Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Avatar, Morgan (from Chrom, Lucina, Walhart or
Olivia.)
*Who can learn this Skill: Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 1.

Description: Grants the unit 50% more Experience while Paired Up with another
unit.

Analysis: In Normal or Hard, this skill can be ignored and the game will still
be easy to complete... but in Lunatic and +, enemies will be too strong. More
Experience means more Level Ups. More Level ups means higher stats. Higher
stats means that the Avatar can effectively handle enemies and makes the mode
MUCH more bearable.

Regardless, there are basically no disvantages for using Pair Up, so you are
getting more Experience basically for free. It falls short of a S rank, because
one day you won't need Experience anymore, making it a wasted slot... one day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6- Solidarity (Tactician, Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Area Buffer Skill, Critical Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Morgan (from Chrom, Lucina, Walhart or Olivia.)
*Who can learn this Skill: Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 1.

Description: Grants Crit/Dodge +10 to all adjacent allies.

Analysis: First of all, Dodge isn't the same as Avoid. It's similar, but it
works as a foil to the Critical Hit Rate instead.

About the skill itself... It has a very limited area, but both yours and the
enemy's Critical Hit Rate will be very low. You can raise yours, and likely
nullify the enemy's thanks to this Skill.

But, this Skill's range, or lack of thereof, really hurts it. It's effects can
be replicated in the exact same way with a few support, making it's usefulness
drop considerably.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7- Ignis (Grandmaster, Level 5).
Rank: A
Classification: Offensive Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 1.

Description: Adds half Magic or Strength to the other value. Trigger % = (Skill
stat).

Analysis: The description is very... undescripctive. Both Magic and Strength
can be used to calculate your Attack, but only one of them. What this skill
does, is add half of the other stat to your damage calculations (Adding
Strength stat/2 for Tomes and Magical Weapons, and Magic stat/2 to Physical
Weapons).

This Skill has a high Trigger Rate, making it's extra damage common to see. But
only a few Classes have the Growth Rates and Caps to make it awesome, namely
classes that use Weapons AND Tomes/Staves. But maxed units can still make
good use of this.

A maxed unit will usually get 20-35 extra damage from this, while you will be
getting around 10-13 extra damage when you first learn it. When you factor in
how often it will be activating, this makes it a force of nature. It's special
animation is pretty sick, too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8- Rally Spectrum (Grandmaster, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 1.


Description: Use "Rally" to grant +4 to all stats to units within 3 spaces for
one turn.

Analysis: This Skill will greatly enhance any unit's fighting ability. You will
be dealing more damage while taking less, and the speed increase can lead to
either more damage dealt (you double) or less taken (the enemy doesn't double
anymore). The Skill and Luck bonuses won't be doing much, though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9- Armsthrift (Mercenary, Level 1).
Rank: A
Classification: Support Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Gregor, Flavia, Inigo, Severa.
*Who can learn this Skill: Donnel, Cordelia, Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Gerome,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Mercenary from Vaike)
Max = 4.

Description: Attack without spending a weapon use. Trigger % = (Luck stat x2).

Analysis:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Armsthrift is a Trigger Skill, but the game never directly tells you if
it triggered in a battle, so the only way to know is to check your inventory.

*Staves don't count as weapons, so Armsthrift will never activate for them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Skill is useful for keeping Legendary weapons forever. Maxed characters
will have no trouble activating this in almost every combat, specially if they
have Limit Break (Skill 94). This is something for endgame chapters and late
DLC maps. Not all Legendaries are worth keeping, as they will be outclassed by
forged Braves.

A forged Nosferatu/Aversa's Night is well worth keeping, since a Sorceror's job
is to spam them, and they don't last long.

Early in the game, there is nothing, outside of a few lucky drops, you will
need to keep. It's not like your Luck stat will be high enough anyway. You can
still forge weapons, but chances are, you can get more powerful ones by the
time it would break.

You can get more of those legendaires through DLC (Infinite Regalia), you only
need to waste TWO minutes if you skip everything. And a little luck. Likewise,
you can get money for more Forges via another DLC map (Golden Gaffe)

This Skill can be a total waste of a slot if you are fine with grinding and
depending on what weapons you use, or a godsend when you want to spam those
legendaries, it all depends on how do you like to play (and what difficulty you
are playing, too).

10- Patience (Mercenary, Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Accuracy Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Gregor, Flavia, Inigo, Severa, Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Donnel, Cordelia, Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Gerome,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Mercenary from Vaike).
Max = 4
*Weapons that grant this skill: Titania's Axe.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +10 when the unit is under attack.

Analysis: Since this Skill only works in Enemy Phase, it isn't very reliable,
specially since you can't directly choose your opponents in the Enemy Phase,
and enemies don't care if they have a low Hit Rate when attacking. But most of
your battles will be on Enemy Phase, so it still does it's part.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11- Sol (Hero, Level 5).
Rank: S
Classification: Healing Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Flavia, Priam.
*Who can learn this Skill: Gregor, Inigo, Severa, Donnel, Cordelia, Vaike,
Basilio, Gaius, Gerome, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Mercenary from Vaike).
Max = 5.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Sol (Sword).

Description: Absorb HP equal to half damage dealt. Trigger % = (Skill Stat).

Analysis: This skill is the most reliable way for self-healing outside of
Nosferatu (and self-healing is the reason it's so broken). Since it's Trigger
Rate is high, it can be very useful for keeping a character alive throughout
most of the Enemy Phase, where you will take much damage.

It will shine the most in later chapters, where you will have higher damage
output and Trigger Rate. It's still better to have a healing item handy, as
it can possibly not activate when you need it the most. Or a Staff user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12- Axebreaker (Hero, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Weaponbreaker Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Priam.
*Who can learn this Skill: Gregor, Donnel, Cordelia, Flavia, Vaike, Basilio,
Gaius, Inigo, Severa, Gerome, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Mercenary from Vaike).
Max = 5.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Superior Axe.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +50 if the enemy is using an Axe.

Analysis: The bonus is huge, but it just happens that Axes have the lowest Hit
Rates in the game, so it's rather redundant. It still can be used to great
effect, so, don't ignore this skill just for that, specially if you can be
affected by Hammers or Volant Axes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13- Avoid +10 (Myrmidon, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Lon'qu, Say'ri, Owain, Yen'fay, Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Sully, Stahl, Gaius, Gregor, Olivia, Inigo, Kjelle,
Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Brady, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.

Description: Grants Avoid +10 .

Analysis: It will be active no matter what, and can be helpful to minimize any
chances of taking damage when you are already a frail Myrmidon, but there isn't
much more that can be said about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14- Vantage (Myrmidon, Level 10).
Rank: A
Classification: Crisis Skill, Support Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Say'ri, Owain, Yen'fay, Morgan (also from Lon'qu).
*Who can learn this Skill: Lon'qu, Sully, Stahl, Gaius, Gregor, Olivia, Inigo,
Kjelle, Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Brady, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.

Description: If HP is half or less, always strike first, even when attacked.

Analysis: This skill can allow you to survive longer, because attacking first
can save you from the enemy's killing blow.

This is a rare case of a Skill that needs others to be useful. In this case,
you need Wrath and Vengeance (Skills 45 and 65). This will allow your unit to
have greater chances of surviving under half HP, and the added firepower can
make them much more powerful in that state.

It's also an assurance of invincibility to Nosferatu users, since they will
recover health, and more than usual, before a potential killing blow, and can
work similarly, but less reliably, to Sol (Skill 11) users.

By itself, it's can still save you, but it's not that reliable unless you have
high HP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15- Astra (Swordmaster, Level 5).
Rank: A
Classification: Offensive Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Yen'fay
*Who can learn this Skill: Lon'qu, Say'ri, Sully, Stahl, Gaius, Gregor, Olivia,
Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Brady, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Astra (Bow).

Description: Strike five times at half damage. Trigger % = (Skill stat/2).

Analysis: Astra allows the unit to attack 5 times consecutively, and each
strike does half the damage of a normal one, making it's total damage output
2,5 times higher than a normal attack's.

While no other skills can Trigger during Astra, each hit has a chance to be a
Critical Hit, and that makes it the skill with the highest damage modifier in
the game (7,5 times higher than a normal attack).

Of course, that's pretty rare, but the total damage is nothing to sneeze at. It
is almost a Critical Hit by itself. Regardless, it's low Trigger Rate affects
it, and in  higher difficulties, there will be plenty of enemies with Counter
(Skill 42) to make sure that an Astra Trigger will kill YOU.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16- Swordfaire (Swordmaster, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Weaponfaire Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Yen'fay
*Who can learn this Skill: Lon'qu, Say'ri, Sully, Stahl, Gaius, Gregor, Olivia,
Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Brady, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.

Description: Grants Strength +5 if using a Sword (Magic +5 if using a Levin
Sword).

Analysis: Swords are the weakest weapons in the game, so this bonus can be very
meaningful to Sword users, specially since most have more than enough speed to
double it's effects.

The bonus, however, is quite small, and compared to other Skills, it isn't the
most effective way of increasing your damage output, since it only works with a
single weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17- Locktouch (Thief, Level 1).
Rank: B
Classification: Support Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Gaius, Anna, Gangrel, Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Kellam, Lon'qu, Panne, Henry, Flavia, Yarne,
Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.

Description: Allows the unit to open doors and chests without a key.

Analysis: The number of doors and chests in this game is much bigger than the
number of keys, so this skill will see a lot of use.

It isn't a skill you want to bring to the hardest maps, since they lack doors
or chests, and only one chest in the entire game is REALLY important (the Boots
on Chapter 17), since you can get everything else from shops.

Of course, you really should try to open every chest you can, and opening a
door on the right time can lead to a smart ambush from two sides, but it's
still a limited skill.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18- Movement +1 (Thief, Level 10).
Rank: B
Classification: Movement Skill, External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Anna, Gangrel, Morgan (also from Gaius).
*Who can learn this Skill: Gaius, Vaike, Kellam, Lon'qu, Panne, Henry, Flavia,
Yarne, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.

Description: Grants Movement +1.

Analysis: More movement is always good. This little boost can help you arrive
at the right place, in the right time. Sadly, that's a full slot just for it,
and this is what stops it from being better.

Boots outclass this, but you only get 2 pairs (and considering how much Renown
you need for the second...).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19- Lethality (Assassin, Level 5).
Rank: C
Classification: Offensive Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Lon'qu, Say'ri, Sully, Stahl, Gaius, Anna, Gregor,
Olivia, Vaike, Kellam, Panne, Henry, Flavia, Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Yarne,
Gangrel, Yen'fay, Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Brady, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Laurent,
Noire, Nah.
Max = 9.

Description: Fell an enemy in one hit. Trigger % = (Skill stat/4).

Analysis: This skill will instantly kill the enemy when it triggers, unless
they Trigger Miracle (Skill 69). This  is really awesome, so why is it ranked
so low?

Well, it's Trigger Rate is ridiculously low, with maxed units and a LOT of
extra boost, you can only get around 33%. Other Offensive Skills will do enough
damage to kill an enemy with a higher Trigger Rate, and so will Critical Hits.

BUT, it's a very good skill for a Streetpass team, since killing someone means
you won, because they will reset (or most will).

Also, this Skill will never Trigger against Dragonskin (Enemy Skill) users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20- Pass (Assassin, Level 15).
Rank: C
Classification: Movement Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Lon'qu, Say'ri, Sully, Stahl, Gaius, Anna, Gregor,
Olivia, Vaike, Kellam, Panne, Henry, Flavia, Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Yarne,
Gangrel, Yen'fay, Priam, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Brady, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Laurent,
Noire, Nah.
Max = 9.

Description: Allows the unit to pass through spaces occupied by enemy units.

Analysis: While this can allow you to slip by the enemy's formation to kill a
key target... unless the unit has Galeforce (Skill 38), you will be left in a
dangerous situation, because behind an enemy... there will be more enemies. It
still has it's uses, but it only works well in very specific situations.

Some consider this skill for Bow users, since you can't attack if 4 enemies
have you cornered... but frankly, who would allow this to happen? This IS a
strategy game, right?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21- Lucky Seven (Trickster, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Gangrel.
*Who can learn this Skill: Gaius, Anna, Vaike, Kellam, Lon'qu, Panne, Henry,
Flavia, Yarne, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +20 for the first seven turns.

Analysis: While seven turns might look like it isn't much, by that time you
will be done with the hardest parts of many maps, and and army of Galeforce
(Skill 38) users should clear most chapters before that time limit is up. This
makes it the best Accuracy Skill to bring later on, outside of, possibly,
Weaponbreaker Skills.

The bonus isn't small, too, so it can give a decent help to anyone, specially
that Avoid bonus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22- Acrobat (Trickster, Level 15).
Rank: C
Classification: Movement Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Gangrel.
*Who can learn this Skill: Gaius, Anna, Vaike, Kellam, Lon'qu, Panne, Henry,
Flavia, Yarne, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Severa, Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 6.

Description: Treats all accessible terrain as if it were a Plain,
movement-wise.

Analysis: Plains don't have movement penalities, like Forests and Deserts, so
this allows an unit to move freely through these area. But, there are few maps
where there are enough of those spaces to justify bringing this skill.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23- Discipline (Cavalier, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: Internal Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Frederick, Sully, Stahl, Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Chrom, Ricken, Lucina, Brady, Kjelle, Avatar,
Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Doubles the amount of Weapon Experience the unit recieves.

Analysis: The bonus is really useful for everybody who can have 2 or 3 weapons
to use, because it will take a while to level up all of them. It will make your
character stronger in a faster rate, and coupled with Joke weapons abuse, you
will be getting lots of Weapon Experience. It will, however, be useless when
you are done grinding.

But you can just play the game normally, and you will eventually get to use the
best weapons with no trouble. Being able to forge Bronze weapons for that
specific purpose is also something that hurts this Skill. It's really good only
when you already have it. Still, getting out of an E Rank for your new weapons
is something everybody likes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24- Outdoor Fighter (Cavalier, Level 10).
Rank: D
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:

Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +10 while fighting outdoors.

Analysis: While the great majority of this game's chapters are outdoor battles,
this skill offers too little to be worth a slot. It's also completely useless
on some maps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25- Defender (Paladin, Level 5).
Rank: C
Classification: Partner Skill, External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sully, Stahl, Chrom, Ricken, Lucina,
Brady, Kjelle, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants +1 to all stats while paired with another unit.

Analysis: +1 isn't going to be doing much for you in most cases. It's still not
a total waste, but there are better ways to support your team. Also, it does
not increase Movement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26- Aegis (Paladin, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Defensive Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sully, Stahl, Chrom, Ricken, Lucina,
Brady, Kjelle, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Noire, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Halve Bow/Tome/Dragonstone damage. Trigger % = (Skill stat).

Analysis: You will almost never face Dragonstone users in this game, and Bows
are only really dangerous to fliers... but even with Aegis, it isn't a good
idea to throw fliers in an Archer's range.

But, it has an effect on Tomes, the most dangerous form of attack in the game,
specially since many characters will have a VERY low Resistance stat without
grinding. This will greatly reduces their threat, specially because by the time
where the higher level Tomes are being used by the enemies... your Skill stat
will be high enough for it to activate most of the time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27- Luna (Great Knight, Level 5).
Rank: A
Classification: Offensive Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who stats with this Skill: Priam.
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sully, Stahl, Chrom, Ricken, Sumia,
Kellam, Tharja, Basilio, Flavia, Lucina, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Noire,
Walhart, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Severa, Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Nah.
(Daughters can inherit Knight from Vaike).
Max = 7.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Luna.

Description: Halve enemy Defense/Resistance when attacking. Trigger % = (Skill
stat).

Analysis: This Skill gives a nice damage bonus against most foes, and will have
a very high Trigger Rate to boot. This will be specially useful when you have
to fight an unit with a high Defense stat, as those with high resistance still
can be easily dealt with a Pegasus Knight most of the time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28- Dual Guard+ (Great Knight, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Partner Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sully, Stahl, Chrom, Ricken, Sumia,
Kellam, Tharja, Basilio, Flavia, Lucina, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Noire,
Walhart, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Severa, Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Nah.
(Daughters can inherit Knight from Vaike).
Max = 7.

Description: Increases the Trigger Rate of Dual Strikes by 10%.

Analysis: Dual Guard's Trigger Rate formula is = (Lead Unit's Defense or
Resistance stat + Support Unit's Defense or Resistance stat)/4 + Support bonus.
This bonus is 0 if neither unit has a suport level, and increases by 2,5% for
each rank (leading to a maximum Support bonus of 10% for S ranked pairs).

As you can see, Dual Guard's Trigger Rate won't be very high, even between S
ranked units. At best, it will be more or less 30%, an considering that it
completely negates any damage, that 10% provided by this Skill is very good.

Two little notes: A Dual Guard will block all strikes from Aether and Astra,
and can negate Lethality (Skills 4, 15 and 18). It's also worth noting that
this Skill will be active regardless of the unit being the lead or the support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29- Defense +2 (Knight, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:

*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Severa, Gerome,
Yarne, Laurent, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Knight from Vaike).
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Defense +2.

Analysis: The bonus is small, but an unit may be attacked multiple times in the
course of a battle, so you will be saving 2 damage here, 2 damage there... it's
not a great Skill, but it certainly does enough. It also helps one to tank
enemy attacks better, and even come undamaged from some encounters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30- Indoor Fighter (Knight, Level 10).
Rank: D
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:

*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Severa, Gerome,
Yarne, Laurent, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Knight from Vaike).
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +10 when fighting indoors.

Analysis: Outdoor Fighter (Skill 24) does the same thing in more maps. Outdoor
Fighter isn't good.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31- Rally Defense (General, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sumia, Tharja, Basilio, Flavia, Kjelle,
Cynthia, Noire, Walhart, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Severa, Gerome,
Yarne, Laurent, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Knight from Vaike).
Max = 5.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Defense +4 to units within 3 spaces for one
turn.

Analysis: The Defense boosts are good, since the frontlines are infested with
melee units, the boosts can be very helpful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32- Pavise (General, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Defensive Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sumia, Tharja, Basilio, Flavia, Kjelle,
Cynthia, Noire, Walhart, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Severa, Gerome,
Yarne, Laurent, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Knight from Vaike).
Max = 5.

Description: Halve Sword/Lance/Axe/Beaststone/Blight damage. Trigger % = (Skill
stat)

Analysis: Taguels and Revenants are rare foes.. but this Skill covers the most
common weapons in the game. Many enemies will be affected by this Skill, and
it's high Trigger Rate will go a long way in decreasing damage taken for a
frontliner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
33- Speed +2 (Pegasus Knight, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Sumia, Cordelia, Cynthia, Aversa, Morgan.

Female Avatar, Female Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Noire, Nah,
Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Pegasus Knight from Gaius, Donnel and Male
Avatar).
Max = 7.

Description: Grants Speed +2

Analysis: The bonus is small, but a single point of Speed can dramatically
change an entire battle, thanks to double attacks. The bonus still won't do
much most of the time, thanks to the high starting Speed shared by many of
it's users.

But it has the potential to change an entire battle in your favor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

34- Relief (Pegasus Knight, Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Healing Skill, Isolation Skill.

Users:

Cordelia).
*Who can learn this Skill: Sumia, Cordelia, Lissa, Mariabelle, Olivia, Say'ri,
Severa, Emmeryn, Female Avatar, Female Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Noire, Nah,
Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Pegasus Knight from Gaius, Donnel and Male
Avatar).
Max = 7.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: Valbar.

Description: Restores 20% HP each turn if no units are within 3 spaces.

Analysis: If you have the time to go away from the battle for Relief, you have
the time to use a Healing item. Only fliers can make decent use of this skill,
since they can re-join the fray easily, but also can be sent to deal with some
reiforcements alone, specially if the reinforcements are ALSO fliers. 20% isn't
much, specially if it isn't relaible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35- Rally Speed (Falcon Knight, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Sumia, Cordelia, Lissa, Mariabelle, Olivia, Say'ri,

*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Noire, Nah,
Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Pegasus Knight from Gaius, Donnel and Male
Avatar).
Max = 7.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Speed +4 to units within 3 spaces for one
turn.

Analysis: Differently from Speed +2 (Skill 33), this bonus is very likely to
actually impede enemies from doubling you or allow you to double them. Giving
this boost to everyone can seriously increase the damage output of your entire
team, provided you plan around it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36- Lancefaire (Falcon Knight, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Weaponfaire Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Sumia, Cordelia, Lissa, Mariabelle, Olivia, Say'ri,
Cynthia, Severa, Emmeryn, Aversa, Female Avatar, Female Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Noire, Nah,
Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Pegasus Knight from Gaius, Donnel and Male
Avatar).
Max = 7.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: Seth.

Description: Grants Strength +5 if using a Lance (Magic +5 if using a
Shockstick).

Analysis: Lances have decent power, but we have Lance users that are too slow
and Lance users that are too fast, so it's very class-dependant. Falcon Knights
will make more use of this, since they are can only use Lances AND are fast
enough to double the effects of this Skill.

The bonus, however, is quite small, and compared to other Skills, it isn't the
most effective way of increasing your damage output, since it only works with a
single weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
37- Rally Movement (Dark Flier, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Aversa

*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Noire, Nah,
Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Pegasus Knight from Gaius, Donnel and Male
Avatar).
Max = 7.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Movement +1 to units within 3 spaces for one
turn.

Analysis: While the bonus isn't permanent like in Movement +1 (Skill 17), it
still can help your team to move across the map faster, giving an all-around
boost to their ultility. You can use the extra Movement to flee, pursue a key
target, beat the map quickly or just advancing normally. It can always help,
but you need to play your cards right.

Jamke.

Description: Allows the unit to act again upon defeating a foe.

Analysis: One of the best skills in the game. With proper use of Pair Up, a
pair can move 3 times, if both have this skill. It can be used for Hit-and-Run
tactics, specially with Pass (Skill 19), or to clear a map very fast. Moving
again might not seem much now, but when you have an army of Galeforce users...

Just remember to not bring it to Streetpass teams, since most reset when they
die.

39- HP +5 (Fighter, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Vaike, Basilio, Male Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Donnel, Gaius, Gregor, Henry, Gerome, Priam,
Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Female Morgan.
Max = 6.

Description: Grants HP +5.

Analysis: It doesn't do much, but the extra HP can help you survive longer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
40- Zeal (Fighter, Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Critical Skill.
Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Basilio, Male Morgan (Also from Vaike)
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Donnel, Gaius, Gregor, Henry, Gerome, Priam,
Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Female Morgan.
MAx= 6
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Lyn.

Description: Grants Critical +5.

Analysis: The bonus is SMALL... but every bonus counts when we are talking
about Critical Hits. You should only use it if you are making a Critical Hit
build and/or there's nothing better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
41- Rally Strength (Warrior, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Basilio.
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Donnel, Gaius, Gregor, Henry, Owain, Inigo,
Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Gangrel, Priam, Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Noire, Nah, Female
Morgan.
Max = 6.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Palla, DLC Katarina.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Strength +4 to units within 3 spaces for one
turn.

Analysis: Most of your offensive units are going to be enjoying a Strength
boost, and when you factor double attacks, you have a nice Strength +8 for your
team.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42- Counter (Warrior, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Offensive Skill, Support Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Basilio, Donnel, Gaius, Gregor, Henry, Owain,
Inigo, Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Gangrel, Priam, Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Noire, Nah, Female
Morgan.
Max = 6.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Palla, Titania.

Description: Damage taken from an adjacent enemy is dealt back to that foe.

Analysis: The greatest thing against this Skill, is that you NEED to be taking
damage for it to be working, and direct damage to boot. The bonus can be good,
but if it's too big, you are also in trouble...

It works best with classes that with high HP but low Defense, like Warriors or
Taguels.

It's worth noting that this skill won't work against enemies with Dragonskin
(Enemy Skill), or when the enemy lands a killing blow against the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
43- Despoil (Barbarian, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: Support Skill, Trigger Skill, Killing Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Gregor, Henry, Basilio, Owain, Inigo, Yarne,
Laurent, Gangrel, Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Noire,
Nah, Female Morgan.
Max = 4.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Leif's Blade.

Description: Get a Bullion (S) if the unit's target falls. Trigger % = (Luck
stat)

Analysis: This Skill is totally outclassed by a DLC Xenologue (Golden Gaffe, of
the Golden Pack) that gives you much more money. In Normal and Hard, you can
get money freely from enemy skirmishes in early stages (because Frederick can
solo those maps), while in Lunatic and +, you will not be going far without
DLC, so you better get Golden Gaffe while you are at it.

Still, it's a nice way of getting free money during battles, because it will
Trigger often, even if you need to kill an enemy for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
44- Gamble (Barbarian, Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Critical Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Gregor, Henry, Basilio, Owain, Inigo, Yarne,
Laurent, Gangrel, Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Noire,
Nah, Female Morgan.
Max = 4.

Description: Reduces Hit by 5, but grants Critical +10.

Analysis: The bonus is small, but the penalty is even smaller. You are getting
Critical +10 basically for free.

It's still a small bonus, but it's a better choice for Critical Hit builds than
Zeal (Skill 40).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
45- Wrath (Berserker, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Critical Skill, Crisis Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Gregor, Henry, Basilio, Owain, Inigo, Yarne,
Laurent, Gangrel, Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Noire,
Nah, Female Morgan.
Max = 4.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: Nephenee.

Description: Grants Critical +20 when HP is half or less.

Analysis: The best Skill for Critical HIt builds. It also combos really well
with
Vantage and Vengeance (Skills 14 and 65), making you a killing machine at half
HP.

By itself, you will be counting on luck, but having a Killer weapon with you
can be wise.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46- Axefaire (Berserker, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Weaponfaire Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Vaike, Gregor, Henry, Basilio, Owain, Inigo, Yarne,
Laurent, Gangrel, Male Avatar, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome, Noire,
Nah, Female Morgan.
Max = 4.

Description: Grants Strength +5 if using an Axe (Magic +5 if using a Bolt Axe).

Analysis: Axes don't really need much help when we are talking about dealing
damage, but it never hurts (you) to have this around.

The bonus, however, is quite small, and compared to other Skills, it isn't the
most effective way of increasing your damage output, since it only works with a
single weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
47- Strength +2 (Wyvern Rider, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: External Booster Skill, Offensive Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Cherche, Gerome, Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sully, Virion, Lon'qu, Panne, Nowi,
Say'ri, Tiki, Kjelle, Nah, Walhart, Yen'fay, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Strength +2.

Analysis: It's a small bonus, but it can still help you kill until something
better is available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
48- Tantivity (Wyvern Rider, Level 10).
Rank: D
Classification: Isolation Skill, Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Cherche, Gerome, Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Frederick, Sully, Virion, Lon'qu, Panne, Nowi,
Say'ri, Tiki, Kjelle, Nah, Walhart, Yen'fay, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +10 when there are no allies within 3 spaces.

Analysis: This is only useful if you are sending the user alone to deal with a
reinforcement or special threat. And there are few times where that can be
actually useful.

You can, though, send the user ahead to attack and bring their allies in close
by in the same turn. Still, it's not worth the trouble.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
49- Quick Burn (Wyvern Lord, Level 5).
Rank: C
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Cherche, Gerome, Frederick, Sully, Virion, Lon'qu,
Panne, Nowi, Say'ri, Tiki, Kjelle, Nah, Walhart, Yen'fay, Aversa, Avatar,
Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +15 at the start of battle. Stats gradually
revert.

Analysis: It will decrease by 1 for each turn passed, until your bonus is 0 in
turn 16. It will be basically irrelevant by turn 8, but the initial bonus is
nice.

You can combo this with Slow Burn (Skill 66) for a 15 turn bonus of Hit/Avoid
+16.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
50- Swordbreaker (Wyvern Lord, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Weaponbreaker Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Priam.
*Who can learn this Skill: Cherche, Gerome, Frederick, Sully, Virion, Lon'qu,
Panne, Nowi, Say'ri, Tiki, Kjelle, Nah, Walhart, Yen'fay, Aversa, Avatar,
Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire.
Max = 5.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Superior Edge

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +50 if the enemy is using a Sword.

Analysis: Swordsmen have the highest Hit Rates of the game so this bonus can be
very useful even to Lance users. Specially if they are vulnerable to weapons
like Armsorslayers, Wyrmslayers, Falchions and Rapiers. Axe users also enjoy
this fix to their worst match-up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51- Deliverer (Griffon Rider, Level 5).
Rank: A
Classification: Movement Skill, Partner Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Cherche, Gerome, Frederick, Sully, Virion, Lon'qu,
Panne, Nowi, Say'ri, Tiki, Kjelle, Nah, Walhart, Yen'fay, Aversa, Avatar,
Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Movement +2 while paired with another unit.

Analysis: There are few situations where Pair up is not the way to go, so this
is another "free" bonus. More movement is always good, especially if the user's
partner is from a class that already gives Movement +1 during Pair up, like
Great Knight or Griffon Rider.

Ah, yes, just to make it clear, this Skill is meant for lead units.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
52- Lancebreaker (Griffon Rider, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Weaponbreaker Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Priam.
*Who can learn this Skill: Cherche, Gerome, Frederick, Sully, Virion, Lon'qu,
Panne, Nowi, Say'ri, Tiki, Kjelle, Nah, Walhart, Yen'fay, Aversa, Avatar,
Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Cynthia, Severa,
Yarne, Laurent, Noire.
Max = 5.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Superior Lance

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +50 if the enemy is using a Lance.

Analysis: Lance users are usually accurate, so this can help you to have an
edge against them. It is particularly useful for those who are affected by
Beast Killers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53- Skill +2 (Archer, Level 1).
Rank: D
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Virion, Noire, Morgan
*Who can learn this Skill: Chrom, Stahl, Ricken, Tharja, Anna, Lucina, Yen'fay,
Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Skill +2.

Analysis: This boost barely boosts anything. The best you are getting from this
is Trigger Rate +4 for Vengeance (Skill 65). And that's awful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54- Prescience (Archer, Level 10).
Rank: D
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Noire, Morgan (also from Virion).
*Who can learn this Skill: Virion, Chrom, Stahl, Ricken, Tharja, Anna, Lucina,
Yen'fay, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +15 when the unit iniciates an attack.

Analysis: It's similar to Patience (Skill 10), but it will work only on Player
Phase... meaning, not much. Bow users usually don't fight back if attacked, so
this boosts what they can actually do, at the very least... but considering
that hitting things is not something hard for archers, and that you usually do
not attack those who can fight back... It's not reliable for other classes
either.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55- Hit Rate +20 (Sniper, Level 5).
Rank: C
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill:
*Who can learn this Skill: Virion, Chrom, Stahl, Ricken, Tharja, Anna, Lucina,
Noire, Yen'fay, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Hit Rate +20.

Analysis: It's nice, but that's it. Other things can work just as well as this
one, in terms of Accuracy Skills, and most of the others also provide Avoid
boosts. You probably won't need a Hit Rate bonus by the time you get this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
56- Bowfaire (Sniper, Level 15).
Rank: C
Classification: Weaponfaire Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Virion, Chrom, Stahl, Ricken, Tharja, Anna, Lucina,
Noire, Yen'fay, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Nah.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Strength +5 if using a Bow.

Analysis: Unless you are a Sniper, you won't want this Skill. Bows can be used
well if you know what you are doing, but you don't want to focus on them if
there are other weapons available.

The bonus is quite small, and compared to other Skills, it isn't the most
effective way of increasing your damage output, since it only works with a
single weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
57- Rally Skill (Bow Knight, Level 5).
Rank: D
Classification: Rally Skill. (lol)

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Virion, Chrom, Stahl, Ricken, Tharja, Anna, Gregor,
Donnel, Cordelia, Flavia, Noire, Lucina, Inigo, Severa, Yen'fay, Priam, Avatar,
Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Mercenary from Vaike).
Max = 7.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Strength +4 to units within 3 spaces for one
turn.

Analysis: It isn't going to do anything really good. Like with Skill +2 (Skill
53), the best you are getting out of this is Trigger Rate +8 for Vengeance. And
that's still awful, just a little less.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
58- Bowbreaker (Bow Knight, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Weaponbreaker Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Virion, Chrom, Stahl, Ricken, Tharja, Anna, Gregor,
Donnel, Cordelia, Flavia, Noire, Lucina, Inigo, Severa, Yen'fay, Priam,
Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Gerome, Yarne,
Laurent, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Mercenary from Vaike).
Max = 7.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Superior Bow

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +50 if the enemy is using a Bow.

Analysis: Fliers are the only ones who will make great use of this skill, due
to their weakness. While Iote's Shield (Skill 93) is superior to it in this
regard, it can still help to keep your fliers alive. Others won't use this one
much, though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
59- Magic +2 (Mage, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Miriel, Ricken, Laurent, Emmeryn, Morgan (not from
Emmeryn)
*Who can learn this Skill: Virion, Mariabelle, Nowi, Libra, Anna, Tiki, Brady,
Nah, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Noire.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Magic +2.

Analysis: It's a small bonus, but it can still help you kill until something
better is available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
60- Focus (Mage, Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Critical Skill, Isolation Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Laurent, Emmeryn, Morgan (not from Emmeryn, but
also from Miriel or Ricken)
*Who can learn this Skill: Miriel, Ricken, Virion, Mariabelle, Nowi, Libra,
Anna, Tiki, Brady, Nah, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Noire.
Max = 5.

Description: Grants Critical +10 when there are no allies within 3 spaces.

Analysis: Not a reliable way of increasing Critical Hit Rate, and it's not
reliable enough to be in critical builds, but it's still a chance of triple
damage...

Moving the user to meet the enemy first might be a good way of making use of
this Skill without endangering the user, as the rest of the team can catch up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
61- Rally Magic (Sage, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Emmeryn.
*Who can learn this Skill: Miriel, Ricken, Virion, Mariabelle, Nowi, Libra,
Anna, Tiki, Lissa, Kellam, Laurent, Brady, Nah, Owain, Gerome, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Inigo, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome,
Yarne, Noire.
Max = 6.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Magic +4 to units within 3 spaces for one
turn.

Analysis: Your Magic users are already going to hit like a brick, and this will
help them to do even more damage. It will also increase a Staff user's range
and healing output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
62- Tomefaire (Sage, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Weaponfaire Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill:
*Who can learn this Skill: Miriel, Ricken, Virion, Mariabelle, Nowi, Libra,
Anna, Tiki, Lissa, Kellam, Laurent, Brady, Nah, Owain, Gerome, Emmeryn, Avatar,
Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Inigo, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa, Gerome,
Yarne, Noire.
Max = 6.

Description: Grants Magic +5 if using a Tome.

Analysis: Magic is going to do a lot of damage, and this will greatly increase
it's usefulness. Also, Sages can use this Skill's bonus for their Staves.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63- Hex (Dark Mage, Level 1).
Rank: C
Classification: Area Debuffer Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Tharja, Henry, Morgan
*Who can learn this Skill: Miriel, Cordelia, Libra, Severa, Laurent, Noire,
Gangrel, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Gerome, Yarne, Nah.
Max = 3.

Description: Reduces Avoid by 15 for all adjacent enemies.

Analysis: This works like a inverse support. The user does not need to attack
the enemy for this Skilll to activate, allowing other people enjoy the enemy's
curse as long as the user is nearby.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64- Anathema (Dark Mage, Level 10).
Rank: B
Classification: Area Debuffer Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Tharja, Henry, Morgan
*Who can learn this Skill: Miriel, Cordelia, Libra, Severa, Laurent, Noire,
Gangrel, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Gerome, Yarne, Nah.
Max = 3.

Description: Reduces Avoid/Dodge by 10 for all enemies within 3 spaces .

Analysis: First of all, Dodge isn't the same as Avoid. It's similar, but it
works as a foil to the Critical Hit rate instead.

Well, this can affect many enemies at once, and the best part is that if you
lower the enemy's Dodge Rate... you are indirectly boosting your Critical Hit
Rate. You should only be careful with the user, because throwing them out near
enemies can be suicide.

Remember that you can also lure enemies to be nearby the user on Enemy Phase.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
65- Vengeance (Sorceror, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Offensive Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill:
*Who can learn this Skill: Tharja, Henry, Miriel, Cordelia, Libra, Severa,
Laurent, Noire, Gangrel, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Gerome, Yarne, Nah.
Max = 3.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Vengeance.

Description: Add half accured damage to Attacks. Trigger % = (Skill star x 2)

Analysis: For it to be strong, you are required to take quite a bit of damage.
It's Trigger Rate is very high, so even chip damage can help a little, but it's
rather underwhelming most of the time.

When using it together with Vantage and Wrath (Skills 14 and 45), you heavilly
increase your odds of surviving and making the most of those 3 Skills. Another
situations where it's useful, is when you are abusing Nosferatu, because this
Skill will give you more damage and most of your lost health on Enemy Phase.

Alternatively, giving it to a class with high HP and low Defense, like Taguel
or Warrior, can wield great results.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
66- Tomebreaker (Sorceror, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Weaponbreaker Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Henry, Tharja, Miriel, Cordelia, Libra, Severa,
Laurent, Noire, Gangrel, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia,
Gerome, Yarne, Nah.
Max = 3.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Superior Jolt

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +50 if the enemy is using a Tome.

Analysis: Magic usually hits hard, and most of your characters won't have a
good Resistance, so this Skill can be really useful. You can find many accurate
and inaccurate Tomes in this game, so this can help out in many ways.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
67- Slow Burn (Dark Knight, Level 5).
Rank: D
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Henry, Tharja, Miriel, Cordelia, Libra, Ricken,
Virion, Mariabelle, Nowi, Anna, Tiki, Severa, Brady, Nah, Laurent, Noire
Gangrel, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Cynthia, Gerome,
Yarne.
Max = 6.

Description:Increases Hit/Avoid by 1 each turn. Effects end after 15 turns.

Analysis: This Skill takes too long to be actually useful in a battle, and you
can easily finish most battles before that happens.

You can, however, combo this with Quick Burn (Skill 49) for a 15 turn bonus of
Hit/Avoid +16.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
68- Lifetaker (Dark Knight, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Killing Skill, Healing Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Henry, Tharja, Miriel, Cordelia, Libra, Ricken,
Virion, Mariabelle, Nowi, Anna, Tiki, Severa, Brady, Nah, Laurent, Noire,
Gangrel, Aversa, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Inigo, Kjelle, Cynthia, Gerome,
Yarne.
Max = 6.

Description: When attacking, restore 50% if the enemy is defeated.

Analysis: This is decently reliable, since you can easily control when it will
activate. It's recovery rate is high, but healing is far more needed on Enemy
Phase, where this Skill won't activate.

And since this relies on kills, it can be a dangerous gamble, specially on
higher difficulties, where getting kills can be hard. It works really well with
Galefoce (Skill 38), since you also need kills for it to activate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69- Miracle (Cleric/Priest, Level 1).
Rank: B
Classification: Support Skill, Trigger Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Lissa, Libra, Brady, Morgan (Also from Emmeryn).
*Who can learn this Skill: Sumia, Cherche, Kellam, Cynthia, Owain, Gerome,
Emmeryn, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Inigo, Kjelle, Severa, Yarne, Laurent,
Noire, Nah.
Max = 4.

Description: Survive lethal attacks if HP > 1. Trigger % = (Luck stat)

Analysis: This can save you from killing blows, but it's too situational. You
should never count on this Skill activating, and should try to heal yourself
before it's too late instead. It's trigger rate is decent, though.

This Skill's usefulness can vary between Casual Mode and Classic Mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70- Healtouch (Cleric/Priest Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Support Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Libra, Brady, Morgan (Also from Emmeryn and
Lissa).
*Who can learn this Skill: Lissa, Sumia, Cherche, Kellam, Cynthia, Owain,
Gerome, Emmeryn, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Inigo, Kjelle, Severa, Yarne, Laurent,
Noire, Nah.
Max = 4.

Description: Add 5 HP to the amount recovered when Healing allies with a Staff.

Analysis: 5 HP can healp early on, but it will greatly lose it's usefulness
later on. It still can be the difference between life and death, though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
71- Rally Luck (War Cleric/Monk, Level 5).
Rank: D
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Lissa, Sumia, Cherche, Miriel, Mariabelle, Kellam,
Libra, Brady, Owain, Gerome, Cynthia, Emmeryn, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Inigo, Kjelle, Severa, Yarne, Laurent,
Noire, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Troubadour from Henry, Gregor, Donnel and
Male Avatar).
Max = 7.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Luck +8 to units within 3 spaces for one
turn.

Analysis: The bonus is big, but it will barely do anything. At best, it can be
used to give a Trigger Rate +16 bonus to Armsthrift (Skill 9), but that alone
does not justify wasting a turn and a slot with this Skill.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
72- Renewal (War Cleric/Monk, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Healing Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Lissa, Sumia, Cherche, Miriel, Mariabelle, Kellam,
Libra, Brady, Owain, Gerome, Cynthia, Emmeryn, Avatar, Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Inigo, Kjelle, Severa, Yarne, Laurent,
Noire, Nah. (Daughters can inherit Troubadour from Henry, Gregor, Donnel and
Male Avatar).
Max = 7.

Description: Restores 30% Hp at the start of each turn.

Analysis: While it does not work uring Enemy Phase, it's healing output is
great, and it is very reliable. It's one of the best healing options in this
game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
73- Resistance +2 (Troubadour, Level 1).
Rank: D
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Mariabelle, Female Morgan.
*Who can learn this Skill: Lissa, Miriel, Cherche, Emmeryn, Female Avatar,
Female Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Troubadour
from Henry, Gregor, Donnel and Male Avatar).
Max = 7.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: Boey.

Description: Grants Resistance +2.

Analysis: Can be useful for surviving magic early on, as well as baiting magic
users at that point.

Unlike other similar Skills, this one is greatly hindered by it's class. It's
exclusive to females, and not many are going to be reclassing to Troubadour.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
74- Demoiselle (Troubadour, Level 10).
Rank: C
Classification: Area Buffing Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Female Morgan (from Mariabelle)
;*Who can learn this Skill: Mariabelle, Lissa, Miriel, Cherche, Emmeryn, Female
Avatar, Female Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Troubadour
from Henry, Gregor, Donnel and Male Avatar).
Max = 7.

Description: Grants Avoid/Dodge +10 to all male allies within 3 spaces.

Analysis: It would be more useful if it wasn't so picky. The boost is small,
but can help you to get rid of an enemy's Critical Hit Rate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75- Rally Resistance (Valkyrie, Level 5).
Rank: B
Classification: Rally Skill.

*Who can learn this Skill: Mariabelle, Lissa, Miriel, Cherche, Emmeryn, Female
Avatar, Female Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Troubadour
from Henry, Gregor, Donnel and Male Avatar)
Max = 7.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Alm, Horace.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant Resistance +4 to units within 3 spaces for
one turn.

Analysis: This will help you survive magic attacks and fix the awful Resistance
that plagues most characters in this game, even if it's just for a turn.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76- Dual Support + (Valkyrie, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Partner Skill, Critical Skill, Accuracy Skill.

*Who can learn this Skill: Mariabelle, Lissa, Miriel, Cherche, Emmeryn, Female
Avatar, Female Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Owain, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Male Morgan. (Daughters can inherit Troubadour
from Henry, Gregor, Donnel and Male Avatar).
Max = 7.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: Prince Marth, Sigurd.

Description: Increases Dual Support bonuses.

Analysis: Pay attention, because this will be somewhat complicated.

The Dual Support bonuses are the Hit/Avoid/Critical/Dodge Rate ones you get
from your pair-up partner and adjacent units. The exact bonus depends on the
sum of the Support rank between units.

If they don't have a support level yet, the rank is 1. Support levels C, B, A
and S have ranks 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. The highest rank is 12.

Here's a little chart to show the bonuses from each rank:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rank      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12
Hit+      10 10 10 10 15 15 15 15 20 20 20 20
Avoid+    0  10 10 10 10 15 15 15 15 20 20 20
Critical+ 0  0  0  10 10 10 10 15 15 15 15 20
Dodge+    0  0  10 10 10 10 15 15 15 15 20 20.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Skill will increase the support level by 4, making the minumum rank 5. You
can get good bonuses from a S ranked pair with this Skill (rank 9), and
you only need a B support with an adjacent unit to get the maximum bonus. The
best bonus to look for here is the Critical Hit Rate.

The best part about this skill, is that since it's a Partner Skill, the lead
unit doesn't need to use a slot for a Critical Skill or an Accuracy Skill. But,
most of the time, the increase will be just Everything +5. It goes really well
if the lead unit is using a Critical Hit Build, because it frees a slot for
them while providing a much needed Avoid bonus.

This Skill's usefulness greatly depends on how close your units usually are,
making it's usefulness vary considerably from player to player, and even from
map to map. It can also be a good way of making up for DLC/Spotpass units' lack
of support options.

It's worth noting that this Skill will be active regardless of the unit being
the lead or the support, however, only the lead unit can make the Skill work
for adjacent units.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
77- Even Rhythm (Taguel, Level 1).
Rank: D
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Panne, Yarne, Morgan.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +10 on even-numbered turns.

Analysis: Just in case, even numbers are those ending in 0,2,4,6 or 8.

Well, the bonus is small, doesn't work in every turn and requires a lot of
planning to fully use it. It's nice when it's there, but you probably won't
miss it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
78- Beastbane (Taguel, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Support Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Panne, Yarne, Morgan.

Description: Allows units in Taguel form to deal bonus damage to beasts/riders.

Analysis: Basically, your attacks will do triple damage if the target is a
"beast" unit (Taguels, Griffon Riders, and anything on a horse or pegasus).

There will be plenty of those during the "Valm" arc of the story (Chapters 12
through 20), so this can be very useful there. Outside of that, there are few
chapters with many "beasts", so it's usefulness gets decreased. The fliers who
this can be used against are usually out of reach, too.

It also requires you to be a Taguel. If that's a good or bad thing, it's up to
you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
79- Odd Rhythm (Manakete, Level 1).
Rank: D
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Nowi, Tiki, Nah, Female Morgan.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: Tiki.

Description: Grants Hit/Avoid +10 on odd-numbered turns.

Analysis: Just in case, odd numbers are those ending in 1,3,5,7 or 9.

Well, the bonus is small, doesn't work in every turn and requires a lot of
planning to fully use it. It's nice when it's there, but you probably won't
miss it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
80- Wrymsbane (Manakete, Level 15).
Rank: C
Classification: Support Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Tiki.
*Who can learn this Skill: Nowi, Nah, Female Morgan.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: Tiki.

Description: Allows units in Manakete form to deal bonus damage to dragons.

Analysis: Basically, you will do triple damage to Manaketes and wyverns.

You won't face a substancial ammount of wyverns. It can help a lot when you do
face one, though.

It also requires you to be a Manakete. Manaketes are generally sturdy enough to
take strong hits, but they aren't fast, and not strong enough to kill in one
hit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
81- Aptitude (Villager, Level 1).
Rank: A
Classification: Internal Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Donnel, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Female Morgan.
Max = 2.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Marth, DLC Est.

Description: Adds 20% to each stat's odds of increasing at level up.

Analysis: This Skill will make the user get many stats from level ups, making
them strong very quick. In particular, it can help with Resistance growths.

It loses a few points because one day you won't need it anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
82- Underdog (Villager, Level 15).
Rank: C
Classification: Accuracy Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Donnel, Male Morgan.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Owain, Inigo, Brady, Kjelle, Cynthia, Severa,
Gerome, Yarne, Laurent, Noire, Nah, Female Morgan.
Max = 2.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Leif, DLC Est, Brom.
*Weapons that grant this skill: Underdog Bow.

Description: Hit/Avoid +15 if a foe's level is higher. (For advanced classes,
add +20 to level.)

Analysis: You really shouldn't be in Villager after you reach level 10... but
the bonus is not that bad. It will be useless eventually, unless you are in a
Special Class.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
83- Luck +4 (Dancer, Level 1).
Rank: D
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Olivia.
*Who can inherit this Skill: Lucina, Inigo, Morgan.
Max = 3.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Eirika, DLC Est, Prince
Marth, Serra, Lute.

Description: Grants Luck +4.

Analysis: The bonus is small and will barely do anything. At best, it can be
used to give a Trigger Rate +8 bonus to Armsthrift (Skill 9), for Inigo or a
Spotpass Character, but that alone does not justify wasting a turn and a slot
with this Skill. OR wasting Galeforce (Skill 38)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
84- Special Dance (Dancer, Level 15).
Rank: C
Classification: Support Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Olivia.

Description: Allies that act again receive Strength/Magic/Defense/Resistance
+2.

Analysis: ONLY OLIVIA CAN USE THIS SKILL! And only if she's a dancer, too! You
can pass this, but it's a total waste.

The bonuses are small, but they still can help a character to kill something
they couldn't before. It will last through Enemy Phase, and then you will need
to Dance again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
85- Conquest (Conqueror)
Rank: B
Classification: Defensive Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Walhart, Male Morgan.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Ephrain, Zephiel.

Description: Protects from bonus damage against beasts/riders/armor.

Analysis: This covers many weaknesses, but even on higher difficulties, you
won't find many enemies running around to justify using this skill... It's a
nice choice when there ARE enemies with Beast Killers and Armorslyers, though.

It is greatly held back by being limited to few characters only, too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
86- Shadowgift (Aversa).
Rank: A
Classification: Support Skill.

Users:
*Who starts with this Skill: Aversa, Female Morgan.
*Notable Spotpass/DLC characters with this Skill: DLC Micaiah, DLC Katarina.

Description: Allows non-dark mages to use Dark Magic.

Analysis: This Skill will affect Sages, Mages, Valkyries, Dark Fliers, Dark
Knights, Tacticians and Grandmasters.

It can be useful, because Dark Magic is overpowered, but Sorcerors are stuck
only with that. The other classes might be worse in certain areas, but they
all offer new toys to play with. Dark magic is also full of toys for other
classes to enjoy... But you can still just go as a Sorceror.

It is greatly held back by being limited to few characters, though, and both of
it's users can just be Dark Mages...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
87- All Stats +2 (Champions of Yore 3).
Rank: B
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Everyone.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Grants +2 to all stats.

Analysis: This Skill will basically allow you to deal 2 more Damage, survive
2 more Damage, and may allow you to Double an enemy, if not impeding the enemy
from doing the same, and adds a little bit of Trigger Rate for... everything.

Everything is decently useful, and it can be obtained early enough to be of
use. But everything is lacking, too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
88- Paragon (Lost Bloodlines 3).
Rank: A
Classification: Internal Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Everyone.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Doubles the amount of EXP the user receives.

Analysis: This Skill is great for lategame grinding, because you won't be
getting it early enough most of the time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
89- Resistance +10 (Dread Fighter, Level 1).
Rank: A
Classification: External Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Every male character.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Grants Res +10.

Analysis: This is a big boost to something most characters need badly, thanks
to low Resistance Growths, making Magic a dangerous threat. It can be great
even for capped units.

You can get the Dread Scroll required to promote into Demon Fighter from the
DLC Map "Lost Bloodlines 2"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
90- Aggressor (Dread Fighter, Level 15).
Rank: A
Classification: Offensive Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Every male character.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Grants Atk +10 when the unit initiates an attack

Analysis: You can use this Skill to do great ammounts of damage, particularly
with Brave weapons. Even if this does not work during Enemy Phase, it's still
poweruful enough to be used reliably.

You can get the Dread Scroll required to promote into Demon Fighter from the
DLC Map "Lost Bloodlines 2"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
91- Rally Heart (Bride, Level 1).
Rank: A
Classification: Rally Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Every female character.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Use "Rally" to grant +2 all stats/Mov +1 to units within three
spaces for one turn.

Analysis: This combines All Stats +2 and Movement +1 (Skills 87 and 18) in
Rally form. Both are useful Skills, and you get a better option here.

You can get the Wedding Bouquet required to promote into Bride from the DLC Map
"Smash Brethren 2"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
92- Bond (Bride, Level 15).
Rank: B
Classification: Healing Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Every female character.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Restores 10 HP to all allies within three spaces at the start of
each turn.

Analysis: It's Healing output isn't great by lategame standards, but it can
affect many people at once, and that's what makes this Skill good. It's also
a nice option for a Rally Bot.

You can get the Wedding Bouquet required to promote into Bride from the DLC Map
"Smash Brethren 2"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
93- Iote's Shield (Smash Brethren 3).
Rank: B
Classification: Defensive Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Everyone.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Protects from bonus damage against fliers.

Analysis:

It can help fliers to roam freely through the battlefield. Just remember that
while it won't do triple damage, Wind Tomes are still dangerous to most those
from the Wyvern Rider class tree.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
94- Limit Break (Rogues and Redeemers 3).
Rank: S
Classification: Internal Booster Skill.

Users:
*Who can learn this Skill: Everyone.
*Who can inherit this Skill: No one.

Description: Extends all stat caps by 10.

Analysis: This Skill is a REQUIREMENT for the very last DLC map, currently
unnamed. Remember that.

This allows units to have what's basically "All Stats +10", and it's obviously
awesome. It requires grinding to beat the DLC from where you can get it, and
you will need MORE grinding afterwards to reach the caps, but your units will
be much more pwoerful than before.

                            F- Building a Skillset.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With so many Skills to choose from, it's usually very troublesome to build a
Skillset, and here, we will help you with that.

First of all, you need to know what is the unit going to do in the battle. Are
they the lead or the support? Are they focused on offense, defense or are they
balanced? With those things in mind, we can apply skills for a few combinations
of the above. Also, we will be mentioning some useful Skill combinations and
important skills to have around.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              0= Important Skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When making a Skillset, two Skills need to be considered before all else:
Galeforce and Limit Break (Skills 38 and 94), but why is that? Let me explain
the reasons for you.


As you probably know by now, Galeforce grants basically an extra turn for the
user, provided they kill something during player phase. Units with this Skill
need to do some killing when they are the lead, while units without it, need to
have good Skills to support the lead.

There's another case to consider in regards to this Skill: When both units of a
pair have it. You need to plan who is getting the last kill, or in other words,
who will be the lead during Enemy Phase. Most of the time, those roles are
already set, so one unit is going to be more of a support with killing power,
while the other will have plenty of killing power with a focus on survival.

This is, of course, for offensive builds. When taking a defensive skillset in
mind, you usually don't want Galeforce. To finish, Pass (Skill 20) works really
well with the hit-and-run tactics that you can use with Galeforce. It's not
crucial, but it can help a lot, so keep that in mind.


Now, about Limit Break... This Skill can be aquired only via DLC, and one of
the hardest maps you can pay for, so it won't be around for most of the game.
It is, however, a REQUIREMENT if you are planning to take on the very last DLC
map (Currently with no official name, but it is known as "The Strongest One's
Name" as of now).

This limits a bit your Skillsets, since you will need to plan for only 4 Skills
now. You will literally break the game's other maps if you use maxed units with
this Skill, so it will be important mostly for that last DLC alone. All of the
tips here take into account only 4 Skills, just in case you will try that last
challenge.

Regardless, you need a strong team to farm Limit Break manuals for that last
DLC, and not having a full Skillset while you do it is a waste. That, and some
still will want a good team but won't try to beat that last DLC. So, while the
builds listed here are short enough to allow room for Limit Break, there will
be room for another Skill of your choice before you get it, an recommendations
for it.


Lastly, there is a priority order that the game uses to know what Trigger Skill
will go off when you attack:

Lethality > Aether > Astra > Sol > Luna > Ignis > Vengeance (Skills 19, 3, 15,
11, 27, 7 and 65 respectively.). This means that the Skills with the lowest
Trigger Rates are the ones the game will prioritize. Think of it as throwing
a dice for each one. First you throw a dice to see if Lethality will Trigger,
if it doesn't, you throw one for Aether, and etc...


With that covered, we will now talk about what roles the units can have, and
what are kind of Skills you should look for in each case. Those are not THE
absolute and only ways to build your Skillsets. With 94 Skills to choose from,
you can make many cool builds, but these are the ones that I recomend.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              1= Full-time Lead Units and Part-time Support Units.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this isn't clear enough, this means the unit will be almost always, the one
leading the pair into battle. This leads to two things: They will be dealing
and taking a lot of damage. So, we need to work around that.

First, of all, Galeforce. If the unit is stuck with being the lead, it is
because of that Skill, and that also means their partner does not have it, or
have but will only be getting one kill and switching back to support during
Enemy Phase. The exception is if their focus is defensive, but more on that
later.


Now, when talking about dealing damage, you should always have a way to make
the enemy cry some more. The main choice, is if you are going for a Trigger
Offensive Skill or a Trigger Healing Skill, because one will get in the way of
the other. This usually leads to these cases:

1: Sol + a Weaponfaire Skill or Aggressor (Skills 11 and 88).
2: An Offensive Trigger Skill + Renewal or Lifetaker (Skills 72 and 68).
3: Aether + Rightful King (Skils 3 and 4).

Leads focusing more on offense than defense will already have a good damage
output, so the healing on Enemy Phase provided by Sol is the best choice. If,
however, they are good on the defensive department, you should try to up their
offensive game with an Offensive Trigger Skill. Aether + Rightful King is a
special case.

This kinda got Healing Skills out of the way... but there is a case where you
are better off without healing: Vantage + Vengeance + Wrath (Skills 14, 65 and
45). More about this set a little further down.


For the Defensive Skill, we need to know what the unit lacks more: Defense or
Resistance. If they are in need of Defense, you should usually get Pavise
(Skill 32) and call it a day. If they need help with magic, Resistance +10 or
Aegis (Skills 26 and 87) are what you need to be looking for.

There is a special case for Falcon Knights/Dark Fliers, who can also opt for
Iote's Shield (Skill 93). You will give them more freedom that way, altough a
proper strategy can save them from Bows, particularly smart use of Pair up.


Considering use of Limit Break, we are out of space. If you are not using it,
you can consider a support Skill like Armsthrift or Pass (Skills 9 and 20) to
increase the unit's general usefulness. If you used an Offesive Trigger Skill,
you can also make the unit even stronger with a Weaponfaire or Aggressor.
Increasing their chances of landing hits with an Accuracy Skill or a
Weaponbreaker Skill is not out of the question. So, in short:

0: Limit Break
1: Galeforce
2: Offensive Skill
3: Healing Skill
4: Defensive Skill
5: Armsthrift/Pass/Accuracy Skill/Weaponfaire Skill/Aggressor


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          2= Full-time Support Units.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the unit is almost never going to be the lead, you only need to focus on two
aspects: Damage and Support. They will not be attacked, so Defensive Skills or
Healing Skills are generally unwanted. Units in this job never have Galeforce.


When talking about support units and damage, we are stuck with Weaponfaire
Skills and Aggressor since no Trigger Skills work when the unit is the support.


With that covered, we need other ways to support. Here, we are looking at the
Partner Skills. Those skills offer good boosts to the lead's performance. All
of them are good at their supporting job, but you usually should prioritize
Dual Guard+ (Skills 28). If the lead unit is running a  Critical Hit build, you
might want to get Dual Support+ (Skill 76) instead. Deliverer (Skill 51) is a
bad idea for those characters, since the user needs to be leading the pair.


Weaponbreaker Skills are not out of place in those sets, particularly if you
are running with Axes, because then you will have problems with Sword users,
even if you are a support. Remember that they need to be reliable. You could
throw another Partner Skill, though. Area Buffer Skills are also viable, as are
the Area Debuffer Skills and Accuracy Skills in general.


While not related to Skills, it's worth mentioning that those untis should be
using Brave Weapons and that they always should be the support to their Wife or
Husband for the uncreased Dual Attack/Guard Rates. You also should be aware of
what bonuses their class will offer during Pair up. And for the Skillset:

0: Limit Break
1: Weaponfaire Skill/Aggressor
2: Partner Skill
3: Partner Skill
4: Weaponbreaker Skill/Area Buffer Skill/Area Debuffer Skill/Accuracy Skill
5: Partner Skill


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           3= Part-time Lead Units.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part-time leads are units with Galeforce that will only lead once per turn to
activate it, and sometimes in emergencies. As such, they need a mix of the two
jobs described above: killing power and support abilities.


Part-time leads have a choice to make in regards to killing power:

1- A Weaponfaire Skill/Aggressor
2- An Offensive Trigger Skill

With the first option, you will have increased damage during normal AND Dual
Stirkes, even if it isn't much per attack, it will be high when you factor all
the battles fought. Option 2 yeilds a higher damage output during the battle
where they need to kill to activate Galeforce, but only there and emmergency
battles where the usual lead can't... lead.

Since this kind of unit always has another Skill for support, it's usually
better to go with option 2. While they provide greater support, the lead won't,
and both depend on the kill for the strategy to work. Sometimes you don't need
more than a Weaponfaire to kill people, though, and having another teammate to
weaken a foe can help you to get kills, so option 1 is still viable. Offensive
Trigger Skills won't activate when you are the support, so there's also that.


Next, we help their supporting abilities. Since we don't have many slots to
play with, the best choice is a Partner Skill. Deliverer (skill xx) is now a
viable choice, since the unit will be the lead for Galeforce kills.


Lastly, we have another slot to fill, possibly two without Limit Break. Here,
we can add the other option for your offense, another Partner Skill for your
support, or increase your survivability through a Healing Skill or Defensive
Skill. We will only talk about the latter two here, as the others were covered
above.

As usual, for Defensive Skills, we should consider Resistance +10, Pavise and
Aegis (Skills 87, 32 and 26). Like what I said before, if they lack Defense,
go with Pavise, but if their weakness is Resistance, it's a matter of
preference between the other two. Or not, if they are girls.

For Healing Skills, since the unit won't be the lead for the greater part of
the battle, Sol (Skill 11) isn't a good choice. Both Renewal and Lifetaker
(Skills 72 and 68) shine more here, Lifetaker moreso, since a great part of
the strategy revolves around activating Galeforce, and by doing that, you set
off Lifetaker as well. Healing Skills can cover damage taken nicely, so the
loss in raw defensive capacities is diminished.


One last thing to remember is what bonuses both units will offer to each other
during Pair up, and that Part-time leads want to try and kill people with
Brave weapons for a better performance when they are the support. So, for your
Skill slots:

0: Limit Break
1: Galeforce
2: Offensive Skill
3: Partner Skill
4: Healing Skill/Partner Skill/Defensive Skill/Offensive Skill
5: Healing Skill/Partner Skill/Defensive Skill/Offensive Skill


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 4= Tankers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Tanker is a special kind of Full-time lead whose focus is on baiting enemies
and minimizing damage taken. So, unlike the other jobs, support and offense are
not our priority here. as they aren't supposed to be aiming for kills and they
must be leading often. As such, while it's a nice thing to have, Galeforce is
not a priority here. It's nice to have a partner with that, though.


First, to make sure you can withstand damage most of the time, you need to have
ways to deal with all kinds of attacks. This calls in for Paivse (Skill 32) for
physical attacks, while Aegis (Skill 26) takes care of magical attacks. This
time, Resistance +10 (Skill 87) isn't a good idea, since it's good, but not
enough for a Tanker.


Next, we need a way to deal with all the damage that you actually took, or in
other words, a Healing Skill. The best choice here is by far Renewal (Skill
72), as Sol and Lifetaker (Skills 11 and 68) will not work as efficiently,
since they are not good killers or damage dealers, but can be considered.


Tankers are not meant to be supporting units, so a skill for that is only
viable if it's to boost their own accuracy. Usually, that means we are looking
for Swordbreaker (Skill 50) to fix the AxesXSwords matchup, or to deal with
Wyrmslayers/Falchions, but depending the character, other Weaponbreakers can
be used instead. That is a nice option for out last slot, but you can also
consider boosting your offense.

Offense isn't the focus of a Tanker, but their damage output will be bad, we
consider that you usually don't plan on them getting kills, but having an
Offensive Skill isn't a bad idea. Again, killing isn't their job, but there's
no need to focus on reliability, so you might as well go with an Offensive
Skill. Considering the need for at least Pavise, you should always have Luna
(Skill 27) available, but the others can work nicely.

However, since Tankers are Full-time leads in a way, they should be partnered
with a Full-time support or Part-time lead... so, in a way, you can get your
offense boosts via Dual Strikes. You can also get Galeforce instead if you can
and want to. This will be a difficult choice to make, specially if you are
using Limit Break, but it leaves us with:

0: Limit Break
1: Pavise
2: Aegis/Resistance +10
3: Renewal/Sol/Lifetaker
4: Weaponbreaker Skill/Offense Skill/Accuracy Skill/Galeforce
5: Weaponbreaker Skill/Offense Skill/Accuracy Skill/Galeforce


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  5= Nostanks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here, we have this special gamebreaker role. Nostanks, abreviation of
Nosferatu Tankers, are Sorcerors whose focus is to spam Nosferatu or Aversa's
Night (possibly forged in either case) to tank damage. Both Dark Tomes will
work like Sol (Skill 9), as in, they will heal half of the damage dealt. This
makes it a great way to tank hits. While, like Tankers, they will be Full-time
leads whose Skillsets aren't very good at supporting they work a differently
from normal Tankers, mainly on the fact that they are built with offense in
mind, being great Enemy Phase killers, and that they rely on being damaged.
They can also make good use of Galeforce, but it's not crucial to their job
or anything. Give that to your support, if you can.


First of all, the difference between an AWESOME Nostank and a great one is if
they have Armsthrift (Skill 9). Aversa's Night is costly to forge and very
hard to farm (you can only get them from the Barracks or Event Tiles), while
also having poor durability (10 uses), so having that Skill will not only save
you time, but will allow you to spam more efficiently. Those without it can
still run with Nosferatu, who can be bought from normal shops. They have 20
uses, so you can bring more and come back with some uses to spare, and you
can still bring Aversa's Night for emergencies.


Now, for their offense, we have a good case for a few Skills. Vengeance (Skill
65) works in a way that combines really well with Nostanks: Damage taken will
come back as MORE damage, effectively negating all the damage you just took.
Luna and Ignis (Skills 27 and 7) offer nice damage outputs at reliable rates,
and that means more HP. Astra (Skills 15) will bring more damage, but since it
works as multiple hits, you might kill the enemy and have less HP syphoned than
intended, but can still be used.


Frankly, a Nostank doesn't need much more than that, so the rest of the skills
can go for assuring you will surivive. There are 2 big ways: A Healing Skill or
a Crisis Mode Skillset.

For Healing, Renewal (Skill 72) is enough to get rid of whatever damage your
attacks didn't take care of, but Sol (Skill 11), when combined with Nosferatu,
will heal you for ALL of the damage you dealt (50% healing from each), and in
this case, it usually won't get in the way of another Trigger Skill, since the
focus here is in recovering health. You can read more about the "Crisis Mode
Skillset" at the next section.

IF you chose the Healing Skill, you will still have another slot to fill. Here,
you can use Miracle (Skills 69), in case things go horribly wrong before you
can attack or even an Accuracy Skill to make the other Dark Tomes more viable
(not a good choice if you don't have Armsthrift), or even Galeforce. That is,
if you are not needing Shadowgift (Skill 86) to use Dark Tomes is the first
place. There are many good Skills for making Nostanks more effective, and most
don't stand in a "or this or that" position, so, no short version here.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     6= Crisis Mode/Critical Hit Rate Build
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very special and risky set, that I already recommended a few times.
It consists of a Skillset with Vantage + Wrath and/or Vengeance (Skills 14, 45
and 65). What is so special about that set, you ask?

When you are under 50% Hp (for Vantage), You will reap a great offensive bonus
from Vengeance, and a great Critical Hit Rate bonus from Wrath. A forged Killer
weapon and a S ranked partner will make your Critical Hit Rate skyrocket with
this Skillset. Vantage will keep you alive by giving you the first strike, and
this will greatly raise the odds of you killing many foes before they are a
threat.

Astra also works very well in place of Vengeance, because the multiple hits can
turn into multiple Critical Hits... and the rest is history, albeit it's not as
reliable. There's not a good substitute for Wrath in this set, though.


Regardless, we still have another slot to fill, two without Limit Break. You
can try to have another Critical Hit Rate bonus with Zeal, Gamble and Focus
(Skills 40, xx and xx) to increase your odds of massive damage. The bonuses
are small, though. Anathema (Skill xx) can indirectly increase your Critical
Hit Rate by lowering the enemy's Dodge Rate.

You can also opt to try Miracle (Skill xx) for a lucky save. Galeforce is very
useful, as always. You can also try to run with Armsthrift (Skill 9) to keep
your forged Killer Weapons, or if you can, your Sol Katti. Oh, Ruin can also
work well with this set. Galeforce is always good, but not a necessity, since
they can work effectively on Enemy Phase alone, like Nostanks.


As for your partner, you should always try to have two skills for support: Dual
Guard+ and Dual Support+ (Skills 28 and 76). Dual Guards can and will save your
hide from death, while Dual Support helps to raise your Critical Hit and Avoid
bonuses. This leaves us with:

0: Limit Break
1: Vantage
2: Wrath
3: Vengeance/Astra
4: Critical Skills/Anathema/Armsthrift/Miracle/Galeforce
5: Critical Skills/Anathema/Armsthrift/Miracle/Galeforce


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                7= Rally Bots
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rally Bot is a character specialized in using Rally Skills. Their Skillsets
are totally made up of those, so they are not meant for any other role.

Before we decide on the Skills, you should decide who you want to make a Rally
Bot. The bests Rally Bots are Spotpass Characters: They have access to the same
classes of an Avatar, but they cannot support with anyone. Other characters
might have good options for this role, but they are generally better elsewhere.


First, there are a few limitations regarding gender. Rally Strength (Skill xx)
is exclusive to males, while Rally Resistance, Rally Speed, Rally Movement and
Rally Heart (Skills xx, xx, xx and xx) are exclusive to females. So, the best
choice is usually to have 2 Rally Bots, one of each gender.

Regardless, all Rally Bots want Rally Spectrum (Skill xx). It's by far the best
Rally Skill, and covers a little of everything.


Females also want Rally Heart. It's similarly well-rounded and covers what
Rally Movement would have done. The other two slots can go to the othe two
exclusive Rally Skills: Rally Speed and Rally Resistance.

Males should cover their exclusive Skill: Rally Strenght, and the remaining
useful ones: Rally Magic and Rally Defense.


Rally Skill and Rally Luck are bad, and should only be used if you have a slot
left from not having Limit Break. Other options for this last slot are Bond
(Skill 90), as well as Area Buffer Skills and Area Debuffer Skills. You will
usually not have room for a partner in most chapters, but if you have, their
partner generally wants to be using Dual Guard+ (Skill xx) to cover their
defense or Dual Support+ to be covering their lack of supports.

Males:
0: Limit Break
1: Rally Spectrum
2: Rally Strength
3: Rally Magic
4: Rally Defense
5: Rally Skill/Rally Luck

Females:
0: Limit Break
1: Rally Spectrum
2: Rally Heart
3: Rally Speed
4: Rally Resistance
5: Rally Skill/Rally Luck


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 8= Streetpass
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you make a team for other players to fight in Streetpass battles, many of
the builds and strategies you make will not go as smoothly, since you won't be
in control of your team. Here, we won't look for a special build, just what you
should try to change around from your main builds.


Killing Skills are generally bad ideas for those teams, as most people will be
resetting if a character dies. Rally Skills won't be used strategically, and
almost all Skills that are made for support will be rendered useless, since the
CPU cannot fight as two, and they won't try to be alone for Isolation Skills.
So, we need to focus on what the CPU does the best: rushing in without a care.


Pass (Skill xx) is a very valuable Skill to bring, as it will disrupt enemy
formations and make they bring a better strategy. Counter (Skill xx) will also
be a major annoyance for many foes, something that you can easily see how for
yourself in Lunatic+...


Since the enemy's pairs will be generally strong than your individual units, we
need to focus on Defensive Skills. As always, Aegis and Pavise are the ones you
are looking for. Lethality (Skill xx) can make many teams a pain to deal with.

Healing Skills are always good to maintain your team, while Accuracy Skills,
specially Weaponbreaker Skills, will greatly increase your team's difficulty to
beat.


The only thing you can't really account for is movement, as certain chapters
will greatly slow you down, but the enemy can work around that.
