Introduction     [INTR]
=======================

Well, here we go. Welcome to my Character and Parenting Guide for Fire Emblem:
Awakening. This will be the first guide I have written for GameFAQs.

IMPORTANT:
----------
This guide is meant to assist in optimizing your characters and party so that
can get through the main story, as well as most, if not all, of the DLC
episodes. There is very little focus in this guide on Streetpass team building,
although I may add a section in the future.

This guide contains spoilers concerning characters, but very little as far as
the actual story goes.

The content contained herein is my opinion. It is based on facts and my
experience, but also on my playstyle. Final stats are subject to the Random
Number Generator (RNG), so results may vary.

You may or may not disagree with me. Due to the gameplay options of this game,
pretty much any character has potential, if you want to DLC-grind. Let me
repeat: because characters can level up an infinite number of times, and
because there is an infinite amount of EXP available through DLC and enemy
encounters, any character can become a force to be reckoned with.

However, some characters are better than others, due to class and skill
options, maximum stats, and the amount of effort needed for you to help them
reach their full potential.

Please read the notes at the beginning of each section, as they contain
information that is applicable to the entire section.

Also, please be aware that some of the growth rates are estimates, and may not
be 100% accurate. However, if they're not exact, they're pretty darn close.


10 Notes About My Playstyle:
----------------------------
To better explain some of the recommendations in this guide, I am going to
briefly go over my personal playstyle. I hope that this will help you see why
I put such a high emphasis on certain skills (recovery skills, Armsthrift, and
Galeforce). First, the highlights:

1) All characters capable of being damaged should be self-sufficient. I hate
babysitting healers who have limited damage potential and survivability. Also,
a turn spent healing through use of an item or stave is a turn that could have
been used to attack or reposition. This is why I put such a heavy emphasis on
healing skills.

2) My general strategy involves moving a strong unit just inside of an enemy's
movement range, or to advantageous terrain, or plugging a choke point on the
map to establish a strong defensive position and force enemies to attack me.
Often these strong units go off on their own to do this or will absorb a lot
of hits if filling a choke point; another reason I put a high value on recovery
skills.

3) I do not, under any circumstances, let my characters die. If they do, I
instantly reset the game. I only play on Classic mode. I do not rush through a
chapter (unless given a time limit), and I value survivability over all else.

4) I hate it when my unique, rare, and legendary weapons break, and I even get
annoyed when their usage drops. Although more can often be obtained through the
use of the Infinite Regalia DLC, there is no guarantee that I will get any
specific weapon again even after repeatedly playing it. Since my strategy
involves forcing the enemy to attack me, some of my front-line units can burn
through weapons quickly. For that reason, I put a strong emphasis on Armsthrift
for all characters who wield legendary weapons, front-line fighters, and
Nosferatu-tanks.

5) Galeforce is indisputably awesome. I use it not only for more offense, but
also for added mobility to quickly move across the map. However, as stated
above, I put a high emphasis on survivability. Therefore, one of my favorite
skill combos is Galeforce + Lifetaker. It has saved me many times, especially
on higher difficulties.

6) I generally lump my characters into one of 3 of catagories: Front-liner,
High-Mobility Offensive, and Support. Front-liners are characters who can
absorb massive numbers of hits, plug choke points, and usually get a ORKO on
enemies who attack them. High-mobility offensive units are nearly always
equipped with Galeforce. They employ hit and run tactics, or sweep through
large groups of enemies in a short amount of time. They also can move across
the map very quickly to intercept enemy thieves or complete optional objectives
such as protecting an NPC. Since they are often used to quickly traverse the
map (away from the bulk of my forces), I try to make them as self-sufficient as
possible. Support units are everything else: ranged attackers who strike from
behind my Front-liners, healers, units who always pair up with other characters
to provide Dual Support/Guard/Strike and stat bonuses, etc. Since most of my
characters have high survivability, my use of Support units is often limited.
The majority of my characters fall into one of the first two catagories (or
both).

7) I hate feeling cheated by probabilities. This is why I don't usually rely on
skills such as Lethality (which has a Skill/4 % chance of activating).

8) I am a DLC-grinder. On my recent Lunatic playthrough, I dumped 80+ hours
into the game to fully optimize my team before completing it. This guide does
not assume that you will do the same, but it does assume that you are willing
to play more than just the main storyline and paralogue chapters.

9) There are some skills that other people have used to great success that I
just don't for various reasons. One example is Counter: most of the characters
I use that could learn Counter can also learn Sol. Since I rely upon Sol for
self-healing during the enemy turn, I do not want to reduce the HP of enemies
except by my attacks (which have a chance to return 50% of the damage dealt).

10) I also put a much higher emphasis on good skill sets than perfect stats. A
character with less-than-perfect stats can still be amazing if equipped with
the right skills. On the other hand, a character with great stats is often
outclassed if he/she has poor skills to pick from, at least in my experience.

=================================
Maximum Stat Modifiers     [MSMS]
=================================

So, what determines a character's maximum stats? Well, two things: their class,
and their unique character modifiers. Every character has a maximum HP stat of
60 for base classes and 80 for advanced classes, but the rest of them are
dependant on unique stat modifiers (which you will find listed in the guide in
each character entry), referred to in this guide as Maximum Stat Modifiers or
MSMs.

Children have a special system for determining their maximum stat modifiers,
which will be covered in a separate section. See the "Parenting for Dummies"
section for more information.

To determine a character's maximum stats, apply their maximum stat modifers to
their class maximum stats, shown below:

Now, let's look at an example. Say you've decided to make Chrom a Great Knight
as his final class. Here are the stat caps for the Great Knight class...

    +------------------------+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |    Class Name          | HP | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
    +------------------------+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |    Great Knight        | 80 | 48  | 20  | 34  | 37  | 45  | 48  | 30  |
    +------------------------+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

And here are Chrom's maximum stat modifiers (MSMs).

          Chrom's MSMs:
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | +1  |     | +1  | +1  | +1  | -1  | -1  |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Therefore, we end up with...

                              +----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                              | HP | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |

  +---------------------------+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

*As a Great Knight.


Now, in case you were wondering, if you switch from an advanced class to a base
class, and your current stats before switching exceed the stat caps for the
base class, don't worry! Any stat growths that you have gained as a result of
leveling up are saved. Once you switch back into a class that has a stat cap
high enough to take advantage of your previous growths, those stat gains will
reappear.

Also, it should be noted that by equipping the Limit Breaker skill, all of a
character's maximum stat caps are increased by +10, allowing them to continue
gaining stats upon leveling up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=================================
Calculating Base Stats     [CBST]
=================================

To calculate a character's base stats (useful for when switching to a new
class), the formula is as follows:

(Current Stats - Current Class Base Stats) + (New Class Base Stats) = New Stats

Of course, a character's new stats after changing classes cannot exceed the
maximum stat caps for that class (after modifiers are applied). If you switched
into a class where you would have enough of a given stat to exceed the stat
cap, don't worry! The game keeps track of all of your stat gains. Any time you
level up and get a +1 for a stat, it is recorded, and upon switching to a class
that has a higher stat cap, those stat gains will be restored to you.

Below is a chart containing all of the class base stats*:

*Base Luck for all classes is 0.

Base class stats are also important for calculating the base stats of the
recruitable children. The formula is as follows:

     [(MC - MB) + (FC - FB) + (CL)]/3 + (CC) = Child's Actual Base Stats

Where MC is the mother's current stats and MB is the mother's base stats, FC is
the father's current stats and FB is the father's base stats, CL is the child's
listed base stats (see each child's character entry in this guide), and CC is
the child's class base stats.

Parenting For Dummies     [PRFD]
================================

Fire Emblem: Awakening introduces a new mechanic to the series (at least for us
Americans): marriage and recruitable chilren, based on who gets married.
Children characters are some of the strongest in the game, benefitting from
their parents' hard training. This is because parents each pass down stats, a
skill, and class options to their children. For example, if you marry Chrom to
a female Avatar, then both Lucina and Morgan will have access to Aether, and be
able to change to almost ANY class. You can also use your matchmaking skills to
cover a child's weakness (make Tharja marry someone with high Luck so Noire
doesn't have terrible Luck stat like her mother) or to further increase their
strengths (marry Vaike and Nowi so that Nah hits even harder).

The mechanics are fairly simple, at least at first glance. Any two characters
that reach S-Rank Support will get married, at which point (assuming you are
far enough into the story) you can recruit the child in a paralogue sidequest.

Children will inherit the skill equipped in the LAST SLOT of their skill list
at the time you start the paralogue mission, so don't worry about rearranging
your characters' skill lists until you are actually ready to recruit the child.
Also, some of the children recruitment chapters are fairly difficult/annoying
because of NPCs (Severa's comes to mind).

Another important thing to consider is that children will inherit all of the
classes that their parents have, with the exception of classes they can't be
due to gender requirements (male children cannot become pegasus knights, for
example). The inherited skills, however, are NOT limited by class gender
requirements, meaning that skills like Galeforce, the level 15 Dark Flier
skill, can be passed down to male children, even though that male child would
never normally have access to Galeforce or the Dark Flier class.

Children will inherit growth rates based upon the growth rates of their father,
mother, and themselves. The growth rates used for the child in the calculation
are listed in each character entry. The formula is:

(Father's Growth Rates + Mother's Growth Rates + Child's Growth Rates) / 3

As a brief note, DLC-only skills such as Paragon, and skills from the Bride
and Dread Fighter class CANNOT be passed down. However, you can simply replay
the corresponding DLC mission to get another copy of the skill/class item.

Chrom wil always pass down Rightful King to his male children, and Aether to
his female children.

Gaius and Donnel will pass down the ability to change into a Pegasus Knight to
their daughters (but only to their daughters as Pegasus Knight is a gender-
specific class). This means that Gaius's and Donnel's daughters will be able to
promote into Dark Fliers and thereby get access to Galeforce.

With all of the above noted, I highly encourage you to plan in advance, and
write it down. On my recent Lunatic playthough, I put everything into a nice
Excel spreadsheet that I could pull up whenever I wanted. Since parents can
only get married once, it is important to plan things out if you want to
optimize your characters.

Furthermore, take the time to raise your parent units up and invest in
hard-to-get skills that can be passed down to their children. Especially good
ones are Galeforce (this should pretty much be passed down whenever possible),
Sol, Armsthrift, and Lifetaker. Keep an eye out for ways to get your children
skill and class combinations that are extremely useful, or that they would not
normally be able to obtain without planning.


Here's an example:

Chrom                     Female Avatar            Morgan (Male)
-----                     -------------            -------------
Dual Strike+              Ignis                    Veteran (default)
Charm              +      Rally Spectrum     =     Solidarity (default)
Aether                    Lifetaker                Rightful King (from Chrom)
Rightful King             Armsthrift               Galeforce (from Avatar)
Luna                      Galeforce


Here's another example:

Ricken                    Lissa                    Owain
------                    -----                    -----
Magic +2                  Miracle                  Avoid +10 (default)
Focus              +      Healtouch          =     Vantage (default)
Slow Burn                 Rally Movement           Lifetaker (from Ricken)
Lifetaker                 Galeforce                Galeforce (from Lissa)


Since your Avatar can marry ANY CHARACTER of the opposite gender, Morgan
(Avatar's child) is easily the most versatile character in the game. You
can even marry the Spotpass characters such as Aversa and Walhart (who have
exclusive skills) and other children (such as Avatar+Severa).

The other important part to consider when choosing who will get hitched is stat
modifiers. As mentioned above, a character's actual stat caps are determined by
taking their class maximum stats and combining them with with their unique
maximum stat modifers (which will be listed in the guide in each entry). The
way that children's maximum stat modifiers are determined is... you guessed it:
through inheritance.

To calculate a child's maximum stat modifiers (MSM), the formula is as follows:

For any given stat: (Father's MSM + Mother's MSM + 1) = Child's MSM

So, as an example, let's say Chrom marries Sumia. Their modifiers are below:


          Chrom's MSMs:
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | +1  |     | +1  | +1  | +1  | -1  | -1  |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


          Sumia's MSMs:
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | -2  |     | +2  | +3  |     | -2  | +1  |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

So, by combining those and adding +1, we get...

          Cynthia's MSMs:
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          |     | +1  | +4  | +5  | +2  | -2  | +1  |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

As you can see, this is a very important thing to consider, especially if you
want the child to specialize in a given stat like Strength, or if you want a
child to end up with at least 50 Luck for Armsthrift without the use of Limit
Breaker.

Community-Decided Pairings Rating Chart     [CDPR]
==================================================

Notes:
------

1) These rankings come from the GameFAQs community after fairly extensive
discussion. These are the final results of a series of "Rate the Character"
threads created by guedesbrawl. I had no part in any of the discussions, and
this work is not my own. It is simply taken from those threads for easy access.

2) This chart itself is based off a very similar one created by easymodexz,
also of the GameFAQs community. It has only been modified for the sake of
formatting, as the original table is too wide to fit in this guide. Once again,
this work is not my own.

3) Rankings for Avatar (who would be 12 or the bottom line, depending on
gender), are always SS. Likewise, Maiden!Lucina is given a D-ranking). These
were removed from the chart so it would fit in the guide.

4) Rankings are as followss

     S: The very best pairings. Does not include Avatar.
     A: Great pairings, can't go wrong with these.
     B: Good pairings, can work decently.
     C: Average and limited pairings. Occasionally useful, but could be better.
     D: Terrible. Cripples the children and greatly hurts their potential.

5) For the sake of formatting, the numbers going across the top each represent
a mother. You will find the key located directly below the chart.

To calculate a character's growth rates, add their class growth rates to their
character growth rates (which are listed in each character entry). The
additional class growth rate for Luck is always 0%.

Your Avatar is a lot more... complex than the other characters, so I decided to
give him/her their own section.

Gender: Male or Female (You Decide)
Birthday: You Decide
How to Recruit: Joins automatically at the start of the game.

Available Classes:

Tactician --> Grandmaster

All other regular classes (Limited by gender)

Possible Supports:

All characters, including Spotpass characters. You can achieve S-rank Supports
with all characters of the opposite gender, and A-Rank supports with characters
of the same gender.

Base Stats:*
Lv-01 / Mov-05 / Starting Class: Tactician
HP-19 / Str-06 / Mag-05 / Skl-05 / Spd-06 / Lck-04 / Def-06 / Res-04

*HP picked as an Asset/Flaw (+5/-3), Luck picked as an Asset/Flaw (+4/-2), any

As an example, if you choose HP as your Asset, and Luck as your Flaw, your
Avatar would have +15% HP growth, +5% Defense growth, and +5% Resistance. They
would also have -5% Strength Growth, -5% Magic Growth, and -10% Luck growth.

Likewise, Maximum Stat Modifers also change based on what was selected as an

Your Avatar (also commonly referred to as My Unit, MU, or Robin) is one of the
strongest and most versatile characters in the game, second only to his/her
child Morgan. There is a lot to consider when creating your avatar, with gender
being the most important. Your Avatar is able to marry all characters of the
opposite gender, and their child Morgan's gender will opposite of your
Avatar's. So, if you create a female Avatar, Morgan will be male, which would
mean that both your Avatar an Morgan would have access to Galeforce, and that
Morgan would be able to be the son of Chrom.

However, if you go with a Male Avatar, there are many other options as well: a
Male Avatar could marry Nowi, which would allow Morgan and Nah to both be
practically unstoppable Manakete. Or, if you don't mind waiting and want to
focus primarily on the post/end-game, you could marry Aversa, which would give
Morgan the unique skill Shadowgift.

Ultimately, just do what you feel like doing. It's a game, have fun with it.
No matter what you do, your Avatar and Morgan will both be obscenely powerful.

First Generation Characters     [1GEN]
======================================

NOTES ON FIRST GENERATION CHARACTERS
------------------------------------

1) First generation characters are generally weaker overall than their second
generation counterparts, because they have limited class and skill options,
and cannot inherit base stats and growths.

2) It is important to build relationships between first generation characters
so that you recruit the second generation characters.

3) Some of the first generation characters you have no choice but to use, such
as Chrom.

Chrom is the Lord for this Fire Emblem title, and as Lords go, he's pretty
good. He comes with Falchion, an unbreakable sword that only he can use, and
gets access to some (almost) exclusive skills in Aether and Rightful King,
which are both extremely useful. He plays a lot like the Hero Class, and
usually finds a healthy balance between evading attacks and absorbing them.
You are required to bring Chrom on pretty much everything, so get used to
using him.

I would recommend having him spend some time as a Great Knight to get his
defense and HP up a bit; he is sometimes a little squishier than I would
prefer, and since he's the main character, if he dies, it's game over. Make
absolutely sure to grab Luna; it's awesome combined with Rightful King and
Aether. Dual Guard+ is also an extremely useful skill; with both Dual Strike+
and Dual Guard+, Chrom can be very tough when paired up.

Chrom should also get to level 15 in the Paladin class to pick up Aegis, which
will help him out, espcially once he has Rightful King.

I usually have Chrom's final class be Great Lord, because his options are
pretty limited, and having the Lord be anything other than a Lord seems...
well, kinda wrong. I mean, it was bad enough when they made Ike a "hero", and
don't even get me started on Micaiah... *grumble grumble grumble*

Anyway, as far as marriage and children go, Female Avatar is the best option,
because then Lucina will also gain the benefit of having access to every single
class, and Morgan gets Rightful King. Other options include Sumia or Olivia,
which would then give Lucina access to Galeforce. I would generally avoid
pairing Chrom with Sully.

Be warned, Chrom MUST be married by the end of Chapter 11, or he will marry
whichever female character he shares the highest support level with (excluding
his sister Lissa, because... ewwwww). Since Olivia joins in Chapter 11, if you
want Chrom to marry Olivia, you pretty much need to ensure that all his other
potential brides are already married by then, or ensure that through the first
10 chapters, Chrom builds NO support with any of his other potential brides.

If the requirements are not met, and Chrom is unable to marry any of the above
brides, Chrom will marry a generic female villager (which means Lucina gets
screwed, and Chrom's fatherhood is essentially wasted). This is one reason I
like the Chrom-Female Avatar pairing; they can start building a relationship as
early as the Prologue.

Lissa is your first healer, so she will get a lot of use early in the game. It
may be necessary to pair her up with someone else to protect her. However, she
can become a Pegasus Knight, giving her access to eventually the Dark Flier
class (and Galeforce). She should definitely pick up Galeforce before getting
married.

She does have very good Luck, so I would recommend pairing her with
someone who has access to the Mercenary class for the Armsthrift skill, such as
Gregor. Alternatively, pair her with a mage like Ricken who can become a Dark
Knight and pass down Lifetaker, because Galeforce + Lifetaker is awesomesauce,
plus then Owain will benefit from a nice +Mag mod. Libra and Donnel are other
viable options, with Libra being the better (since Donnel can pass down Pegasus
Knight access to daughters).

Lissa benefits from a LOT of support options; unfortunately her stats rarely
get very good unless you put a lot of time into her. She is a solid healer, and
a great mother because of Galeforce, but I rarely end up using her once other
options open up.

Frederick is a beast at the beginning of the game, and absolutely essential if
you're playing on Lunatic or higher. However, he is an experience hog, since he
starts in an advanced class. His growths are decent enough, and he can remain
useful even later in the game, but usually by then he's outclassed by second-
generation characters, and even other first-genderation riders such as Sully
or Stahl.

I often used Frederick as support unit by pairing him up with characters that
are fast, but not super strong, like Sumia, Panne, or Olivia.

He also suffers from a lack of really good skills. I'd say get him Luna and
pair it with the Aegis + Pavise combo, and then pass down one of the three.
With that combo, he can tank pretty well, and work as a solid roadblock if it's
needed.

Frederick is capable of passing down a very nice +Str and +Def mod to his
children, as well as access to Luna, Dual Guard+, and the Aegis-Pavise combo,
making him highly demanded. He is great for both characters that can use
improved defensive stats, as well as those who can make good use of Luna. Good
candidates include Sumia, Cherche, and Panne, among others.

Sully is the first of the two starter Cavaliers, with the other being Stahl.
Generally she will have better Speed and Skill than Stahl, but poorer HP,
Speed, and Strength. She benefits from pretty good Luck growth as well, but
unfortunately she lacks many skills that can take advantage of it. She is
useful in the early game to pair up with someone for a good Defense boost, and
for her excellent move range. Any character with access to the cavalier line
should reach at least level 15 in the Great Knight class to pick up Luna and
Dual Guard+.

If you decide to use her instead of Stahl, definitely make sure she picks up
Astra and Swordfaire from the Swordmaster class, as they are very beneficial to
her in all of her class options. She makes a fairly decent Assassin, especially
if you spend some time as a Great Knight to bolster her Defense and HP stat a
bit. I generally end up using her instead of Stahl, because it takes time to
foster a support relationship in order to get her daughter Kjelle, whereas
Stahl is not needed in order to recruit every character.

Unfortunately, Sully lacks access to any recovery skills, and also lacks access
to Galeforce and Armsthrift. Her best skills pretty much all come from the
Myrmidon line, unless you want to make her a tank (although there are many
characters, including Stahl, who are better tanks). Because of this, in my
opinion, Stahl is the better unit.

Sully has a few good options in the marriage department. Marrying her to Gaius
or Donnel will allow her daughter to gain access to the Pegasus Knight line,
even though Sully herself cannot access it. Donnel also has great growths as a
result of Aptitude, access to the Mercenary line, and high Luck to make the
most out of it. However, Donnel is a very desirable father, and you make have
better options than Sully. Marrying Sully to Kellam will give her daughter
extremely high defensive stats. Try to avoid pairing Sully with Stahl or
Frederick as that will severely limit Kjelle's class options. Sully is also a
potential wife of Chrom, but once again, that will limit Kjelle's options. I
think her best spouses are Gaius, Kellam, and Donnel. Another additional option
is Vaike, which will give Kjelle extremely high Strength, as well as Axefaire
through inheritance, turning her into a physical powerhouse.

Virion is actually pretty decent; he can pick up Lifetaker as a Dark Knight, he
has decent Strength, Skill, and Speed growths, and if you decide to have him
finish as a Wyvern Lord, he has access to Bowbreaker as well.

He is rather lacking in the offensive skill department, however, and his
durability leaves something to be desired (as you would expect from an archer).
Regardless, he is good for ranged attacks, and in the early game he is great
for weakening enemies so the EXP can be fed to Chrom or Avatar.

As a father, Virion is below average. I would recommend pairing him a mother
that has access to Galeforce, and having Virion pass down Lifetaker (because,
once again, Galeforce + Lifetaker is useful). If you go that route, you should
marry Virion to Lissa, Cordelia, Maribelle, or Olivia. Olivia is Virion's best
potential wife, but Olivia has better options. Another thing you could do would
be to marry Virion to Cherche, as Gerome (a Wyvern Rider) benefits greatly from
Bowbreaker and the +Skl and +Spd mods. Gerome is better as a Berserker,
however. Try to avoid pairing him with Miriel or Tharja, since their children
already have access to Lifetaker. Also consider that he can pass down Bowfaire,
which is helpful for characters who will become an Assassin.

Stahl is the second of your two starting Cavaliers, and the tankier of the two.
Like Sully, some of his best skills come from the Myrmidon line, but Stahl
actually gets enough Defense and HP growth that he can make a solid wall if you
decide to make him a Great Knight. Just watch out for magic-users and enemies
wielding weapons that are super-effective against armor and riders, as his
Resistance is sub-par.

I rarely use Stahl, instead going with Sully simply for relationship-building.
However, as a father, he passes down solid defensive stats, so he can make an
otherwise squishy child more durable.

Since Stahl can pass down Luna, as well as a decent +Str and +Def mod, he is a
very beneficial father. Often, he can be swapped interchangably with Frederick.
Stahl's best wife may be Cordelia, but Cherche is another potential good one.

Vaike is a pretty typical fighter: great Strength and HP, decent Skill and
Speed, and moderate to mediocre everything else. He suffers from awful
Resistance, but his HP is high enough to make up for it.

I would have him spend some time as an Assassin to get his Skill and Speed up
to where they need to be. Sol (from the Hero class) is fantastic in pretty much
all situations. Once you have Sol, Wrath, and Axefaire, Vaike is an offensive
force to be reckoned with. He will deal enough damage to most enemies to OHKO,
and between Wrath and Sol, his HP will rarely stay below 50% for long.

As a father, Vaike passes down above-average offensive stats. You may want to
pair him with a mother who has good resistance, and access to Galeforce and
the Mercenary line, such as Cordelia. Vaike's children will benefit greatly
from Armsthrift, which he is unable to pass down himself. He also makes a
decent husband for Nowi and Panne, whose children both greatly benefit from
access to Sol and a higher Strength stat. Vaike's best wives are probably
Sully (for extremely good physical stats), Gerome (who loves Axefaire), and

Miriel is your first tome-wielder, and she definitely has her magical bases
covered. With access to the Nosferatu tome as a Sorcerer, Lifetaker from the
Dark Knight class, and Tomefaire from the Sage class, she can be a magical
offensive powerhouse.

She is definitely on the squishy side at first, and in the early game is often
more of a liability than a benefit. Feed her some EXP, and make sure she spends
time in the Dark Mage line to boost her lousy Defense. Unfortunately, she lacks
access to Armsthrift, which means there are better Nosferatu-tanks out there.

Miriel is capable of being the mother of a fantastic Nosferatu tank, if paired
correctly. Laurent, while generally too squishy to be a tank, can turn out very
will if Miriel is married to Donnel. Donnel passes down access to the Mercenary
line for Armsthrift (essential for any Nosferatu tank), access to Galeforce, as
well as awesome stat growths from Aptitude. He also will ensure that Laurent
gets good Luck and Survivability stats. You could also pair Miriel with Kellam,
to once again cover that Defense weakness, although this will mean that Laurent
is without Armsthrift. If you don't want to use Donnel as Laurent's father,
consider Gregor; he is very much like Donnel, but does not pass Aptitude. On a
more positive note, Donnel's special trait of passing down Pegasus Knight line
access to his daughters is not wasted on Laurent. If you want Laurent to have
very high Magic, you can marry Miriel to Ricken. The downside is that there is
a lot of class overlap. Lastly, Lon'qu makes an excellent Miriel husband as
well.

Have Miriel pass down Tomefaire, Lifetaker, or Renewal.

Sumia is one of two first-generation Pegasus Knights, and in my opinion, the
lesser of the two. She gets access to Galeforce, and can get decent physcal
stats if she spends some time as a General and Great Knight. She also gets a
much-needed recovery skill in Renewal from the War Cleric line. However, that
means that you have to get to at least level 15 in 3 advanced classes, and that
doesn't include her finishing class.

Sumia has EXTREMELY limited marriage options. The game pushes strongly towards
having her marry Chrom through support conversations and cutscenes, and Chrom
is overall her best marriage option if you do not have a Female Avatar and do
not want to make the extra effort for Chrom to marry Olivia. If Sumia marries
Chrom, Lucina will benefit from Galeforce access. However, Cynthia will not be
able to get Rightful King.

Sumia and Henry pair up quite well, since Sumia can pass down Galeforce and
Henry can pass down Lifetaker right off the bat. This will also give Cynthia
access to the Thief line, which is nice for its movement bonuses. Gaius should
not be wasted on Sumia since Sumia already passes down Galeforce. So really,
your options are Frederick and Henry, with Henry being the stronger of the two.

Kellam is your only first-generation Knight. He makes a pretty good defensive
wall, but is held back by sub-par Speed. This is remedied by having him spend a
while in the Thief line, which gives him the added bonus of much-needed skills
that enhance his movement capability. Renewal (from War Monk) is his only skill
that gives him healing.

In the early game, pairing him up with Frederick can form a defensive wall that
is very difficult to break, while pairing him up with a faster character like
Sumia can add some much needed Strength to them, or Speed to him. By late game,
he is greatly outclassed by other tanks who have better skills, stats, and
class options.

Kellam should marry someone whose child will benefit from his very good +Def
mod, such as Miriel. By pairing him with Sully, Kjelle will have one of the
best Defense stats in the game, but she will suffer from lack of access to a
wide variety of skills. When choosing Kellam's wife, be aware that he can pass
down a fairly nasty -Spd mod. Taking that into account, Kellam's best option is
probably Nowi, since Nah benefits from the extra Strength and Defence.

Donnel is a character that I have mixed feelings about. On higher difficulties,
he can be a major pain to recruit since pretty much any enemy in Paralogue 1
will one-shot him. One of the most reliable ways to recruit him is to pair him
up with Frederick and trap the archer in the upper-left treasure room. Since
the archer will be unable to move, Donnel can attack him repeatedly and he will
gain enough experience to level up once. Just make sure that Frederick drops
him, because if Frederick joins the attack or boosts Donnel's Strength, the
archer will go down too fast.

Donnel has phenominally high growths, but starts out with a terrible class,
horrid base stats, and very low stat caps in his initial Villager class. He is
also severely limited in his class options, having only 3 second-tier classes
that he can Promote to. However, he makes a beast of Hero, and his extremely
high luck stat will ensure that Armsthrift triggers pretty much every time.
The Villager class has horrible growths and even worse caps. Try to use a
Second Seal on Donnel as soon as he hits level 15 and picks up the Underdog
Skill.

To fix his shortcomings (lack of options), consider having him level to 15 as a
Dread Fighter (obtained through the Lost Bloodlines 2 DLC). This will give him
Resistance +10 (which he needs, his Resistance is crap) and Aggressor. Then
have him finish out as a Hero, and he'll be pretty much unkillable between his
very high stats, Sol, and Armsthrift.

Donnel is the ONLY father who can pass down the skill Aptitude, as he is the
only first-generation character who can become a Villager. Pick his wife very
carefully. Donnel's sons can become the Villager class; his daughters cannot.
Instead, his dathers get access to the Pegasus Knight line, and thereby have
access to Galeforce.

Since Donnel passes down access to Galeforce as well as a nice +Lck mod, Tharja
is an excellent option, especially since her daughter Noire is desperately in
need of a Luck boost (Tharja's Luck is terrible). This will give Noire access
to Sol, Armsthrift, Lifetaker, and most importantly, the Dark tome Nosferatu,
which can make Noire a fantastic Nosferatu-tank if you make her a Sorcerer.

For casual players, consider marring Donnel to a female Avatar and passing down
Aptitude, since Morgan can make use of it to hit his stat caps without a great
deal of grinding. Less-casual players will probably want to pass down Counter
or Axefaire, as they are male-exclusive skills.

Donnel's best wives are generally Sully, Tharja, and Nowi, who all benefit from
Aptitude or Counter and access to Galeforce.

Lon'qu is a typical Myrmidon: fast, but not exceptionally hard-hitting. He has
access to the Thief line, which can be helpful for movement-enhancing skills
and the occasional lockpick if needed. Spending some time in the Wyvern Rider
line helps him with his poor Strength and Defense.

Lon'qu starts out equipped with a Killing Edge, which is nice. He has great
evade, but he will die quickly if he takes more than a couple hits. Makes sure
he is not in a position where he will die. Unless you want him to end up as a
Wyvern Lord for his final class, make sure he picks up Swordfaire at some
point.

As a father, Lon'qu has several decent options. Tharja's daughter Noire will
benefit from his high Luck stat, but her potential as a Nosferatu-tank is lost
due to lack of access to Armsthrift. Avoid pairing Olivia with Lon'qu, since
she already passes down the Myrmidon line, and it would severely limit Inigo's
class options. Sully's daughter Kjelle can benefit from his his speed, as can
Cherche's son Gerome.

Lon'qu's best wives, however, are usually Maribelle, Cordelia, and Miriel.

Ricken is the second Mage you get, and by the time you get him, he will usually
already be outclassed by Miriel. Although he's a bit more durable that Miriel,
his offensive capabilities are pretty diminished. His only recovery skill is
Lifetaker, so make sure he picks that up if you plan to use him; he should also
learn it if you plan for him to be a father.

Ricken passes down a nice +3 Mag mod, as well as some decent skill and class
options, including Luna. His best wives are probably Cordelia, One match that
I do like is Lissa, because Owain then gets access to both Galeforce, Luna,
and Lifetaker, as well as a high enough magic stat to be a pretty awesome Dread
Fighter. He can also marry Tharja or Miriel to make their respective children
have very high Magic stats. He's also a good candidate for Panne and Cordelia.

Maribelle is the only default Troubadour in the game, and she actually has a
lot of potential due to her fantastic class options. She can pick up Lifetaker,
Renewal, Tomefaire, and Galeforce, at which point she will pretty much kill
everything and regenerate health very reliably. She is definitely one of the
better first-generation characters, at least skill-wise. She also has very high
Luck.

Unfortunately, she is a major pain to train, since she can't attack until level
10 when you promote her. Speed things along by giving her a Psychic as quickly
as possible. She also suffers from poor survivability, so she'll definitely
need some time investment if you want her to be self-sufficient. Spend some
time as a Dark Knight to boost her Defense. I would recommend having her finish
as a Sage or Valkyrie.

As far as motherhood goes, make SURE she passes down Galeforce, as her son
Brady is otherwise unable to get it. With her class options and skillset, her
son Brady is pretty much guaranteed to turn out alright. Good options for her
husband include Lon'qu, Henry, and Gregor.

I tried so hard to love Panne. As the only first-generation Taguel, she can
transform into a dog/cat-like creature which does super-effective damage to
riders. Unfortunately, that's about all she's good for. She does have access to
the Thief line, so I suppose she could be used to pick locks and such, but she
suffers from lack of high-quality skills.

Panne is very fast, however, so she can serve as a halfway decent Wyvern Lord,
or as a somewhat respectable assassin. She also has very solid HP.

Panne's son, Yarne, is the only other Taguel in the game, unless you have her
marry a Male Avatar (in which case Morgan can also be a Taguel). Unfortunately,
he suffers from many of the same problems. In my opinion, Taguels are greatly
outclassed by their Manakete cousins, and other classes that don't use stones
to transform. Often, a Taguel's best role is in a completely different class:
Taguel Assassins can be pretty awesome, and Panne has has enough Strength,
Skill, and Speed growth rates to be a pretty sweet Wyvern Lord as well.

With high Skill, Taguels can make great use of Sol and Luna. Try marrying Panne
to Donnel or Gregor... all of which may be better served being someone
else's father. I usually marry Panne to one of my "leftover" fathers, like
Stahl, just for the sake of completion. Frederick and Ricken are viable options
as well. If Panne marries Vaike, her son Yarne will have the potential to be
a fantastic Berserker.

Gaius, who is obsessed with candy, is the first enemy character you are able
to recruit. He is a fairly unusual Thief, since he has above-average growths in
HP, Strength, Skill, and Speed, but has below-average Luck. Regardless, he is
one of the better first-generation characters, especially if you get him Sol,
Swordfaire, and Vantage, and then finish him out as an Assassin.

Gaius is one of the most valuable fathers in the game, because if he has a
daughter, she will have access to the Pegasus Knight class, and therefore gain
access to Galeforce, regardless of whether or not her mother has access to it.
The only other father who can say the same is Donnel. This means that you
should carefully select Gaius's wife.

Nowi is a great option; she doesn't suffer from Gaius's poor Luck and Defense,
and a Manakete with Galeforce, Lifetaker, and Sol is just insane. Tharja is
another potential pairing, since Noire normally wouldn't have access to
Galeforce, but Tharja's poor luck combined with Gaius's poor luck will mean
that she will be susceptible to critical hits. However, Galeforce, Lifetaker,
and Sol will mean that she can quickly recover if needed. Lastly, Sully's
daughter Kjelle benefits greatly from access to Galeforce and Sol, although the
Myrmidon line gets wasted since Sully already passes it down.

Try to avoid marrying Gaius to anyone who has a male child, as they will not be

Cordelia, like Maribelle, is another character that benefits greatly from her
access to powerful skills and classes which complement each other. She has
everything needed to be a powerhouse, which is rare for first-generation
characters. Get her Armsthrift, Sol, Galeforce, and Lifetaker. If you can get
her Magic stat high enough, she is capable of being an awesome Nosferatu-tank
due to the skills mentioned above, but honestly she doesn't really need the
Nosferatu tome to recover reliably.

When comparing Cordelia to Sumia, Cordelia hits harder and is a bit more
durable, but Sumia is faster. Sumia, however, does not get access to the wide
range of class/skill options that Cordelia has, and is therefore outclassed by
Cordelia in my opinion.

Cordelia's daughter Severa is very much like her mother; there isn't much she
needs from her father to be awesome as far as skills and classes go. Consider
pairing Cordelia with Ricken or Henry to bolster Severa's Magic stat and make
her a potential Nosferatu-tank. You could also marry her to Kellam to give
Severa better physical stats, and even more class options, or you could pair
her with Libra and pass down the Renewal skill (and a slight Magic boost). Once
again, Severa has pretty much everything she needs right from the get-go. Other
exceptional options include Stahl (for Luna access), and Lon'qu.

Gregor is one of the few male first-generation characters that has access to
everything he needs to be self-sufficient: Sol, Swordfaire/Axefaire, Wrath,
Armsthrift, and Vantage. He has a lot of potential as a powerhouse, but because
he lacks access to the Thief line and Galeforce, he can have some trouble
getting across the map. Don't waste your Boots on him, though; there are better
characters for that.

As a father, Gregor is very useful for access to the Mercenary line; Armsthrift
and Sol are both extremely useful skills. He also can pass down the hard-to-get
Axefaire and Counter skills.

Consider pairing him with Maribelle, who has practically everything else of
consequence, or any of the other mothers that can pass down Galeforce but don't
have access to Armsthrift. Access to the Dark Knight class for Lifetaker is an
added bonus. If he marries Cherche or Panne, their children will have
everything needed to be fantastic Berserkers. He also makes a good husband for
Tharja and Miriel.

Nowi is one of two first-generation Manakete, and in my opinion, the better of
the two. She has great growth rates in everything except for skill and speed
(both of which are only slightly below average) and will serve you well as a
nearly unbreakable wall. Make sure you take the time to get her Lifetaker so
that she has a reliable means of self-recovery.

Although Tiki has higher growth rates than Nowi, Nowi benefits from much more
availability (you get her much earlier) and far more support options. However,
either can be a powerhouse.

Nowi really shines in motherhood, however, provided that you pair her up with
a father who can make the most of the Manakete class. Donnel and Gaius are the
obvious choices, since Nah would then have access to the Galeforce-Lifetaker
combo. If you marry her to a Male Avatar, then Morgan will be able to turn into
a Manakete, and Nah will have access to pretty much every class. If you already
have plans for Donnel, Gaius, and the Avatar, then pair her up with someone
that will enhance one side of the Manakete class: Strength (such as Vaike) or
Defense (such as Kellam). Frederick and Stahl are other options if you want
access to Luna. If she marries Vaike, pass down Axefaire: as a Wyvern Lord, she
can be deadly.

When you get Libra, he will probably be your best healer. He has pretty high
base stats for Chapter 9, and he can take a hit. Best of all, he can actually
hit back. However, as the game progresses, he gets outclassed by Maribelle and
Lissa, among others.

Libra does have access to several useful skills: if you get him Tomefaire,
Lifetaker, and Renewal, and then have him finish as a Sage, he'll be a
fairly self-sufficient magic user who can heal and dish out respectable damage.
As stated, though, he gets outclassed by the end of the game. Use him until you
have a chance to really put some time and resources into Maribelle and Lissa,
or until you get some of the second-generation units capable of healing.

As a father, Libra is most useful for passing down access to his second-tier
classes and their skills; none of them are completely trash. Consider pairing
him with someone who does not have access to Lifetaker or Renewal, such as
Olivia or Sully, or with someone who has access to the Armsthift skill
(Cordelia). He's also a great match for Lissa if you want to turn Owain into
a respectable Sorcerer or magic-user; the same is true for Olivia and Inigo.
He can also match up with Miriel or Tharja if you want their children to have
great +Mag mods, but aren't concerned with class selection.

I swear, Tharja's growth rate for Luck is not really 40%. Or at least, it never
has been for me. Every time I use her, even after a couple class changes, I'm
lucky if her Luck is even in the double digits. Grrrr. *End rant*

Anyway, Tharja suffers from a very... interesting combination of class options.
As a Dark Mage, her defense is reasonably OK, but her other stats prevent her
from being a high-quality tank. Her Strength is too poor to do pretty much
anything physical without a lot of work, and she lacks access to key skills
like Armsthrift, Sol, and Galeforce. She does get access to Nosferatu and
Lifetaker, so at least there's that.

With that said, Dark Mages are few and far between, and if you marry her to the
right guy, her daughter Noire will have everything needed to be an outstanding
Nosferatu-tank. Good options include Gaius (for Galeforce access, and for Sol)
and Donnel (for Galeforce, Sol, and Armsthrift access). You can also pair her
with a Male Avatar to make Tharja godly, but there are better options for your
Avatar unit.

If you don't want to use Donnel or Gaius on Tharja, marry her to someone who
will boost Noire's +Str and +Def mods, such as Kellam or Frederick.

When you first get Anna, she will probably be your best lockpicking character.
She has access to some decent skills in Lifetaker and Assassinate, and she can
move around the map pretty freely thanks to her Thief line, but before long she
is outclassed by other units, such as Gaius, Panne, and pretty much anyone else
who has access to the Thief line.

Anna suffers from terrible support options. She has very high Luck, but doesn't
have the skills to take advantage of it (like Armsthrift). If you decide to use
her, get her Bowfaire and then have her finish as an Assassin.

Anna does not have children. Use her early when you first get her, then bench
her once you get better Thief options.

Olivia is the Dancer in this game, and as a nice change, she can actually do
more than just dance: she has a sword and can actually attack if needed. When
you first get her, she is terribly weak, and you'll have to feed her some kills
so she can gain EXP and level up quite a bit before you can stop babysitting
her.

With access to the Myrmidon and Pegasus Knight lines, she has several good
skills at her disposal: Swordfaire, Galeforce, Assassinate, and Pass. However,
she lacks any reliable self-recovery skills. Due to the unique nature of the
Dancer class, Olivia is a prime candidate to use your Boots on, as the added +2
Movement will help her keep up with the rest of your group as she lets them
act again.

Olivia is a very interesting mother; she can marry Chrom, but it's a gigantic
pain (see Chrom's write-up for details), and her children are not able to
become dancers and make use of her unique skill, Special Dance. This applies
even if she marries a Male Avatar; Morgan will not be able to become a Dancer.
However, she can pass down the much-loved Galeforce skill, and her son Inigo
is pretty awesome. Inigo starts with automatic access to the Mercenary line,
regardless of who his father is. Therefore, Inigo's father should give him
access to other classes (Frederick, Stahl, or Virion) or further complement his
strengths. Alternatively, hook her up with a Mage who can get Inigo access to
some nice recovery skills and turn him into a decent magic-user, such as Ricken
or Libra (with Libra probably being the better, due to the +Str mod).

Cherche is the only default first-generation Wyvern Rider, but she seems to be
hiding a secret desire to ditch her wyvern Minerva and heal instead. While the
War Cleric class gives her access to some recovery in Renewal, she suffers
greatly from lack of offensive skill options. However, with pretty solid growth
rates, she can still fend for herself fairly well, and the mobility of flying
units is always a plus.

Cherche's son Gerome is one of the few male children who cannot under any
circumstances get Galeforce, which hurts him badly. However, he can make up for
it if you pair Cherche up with the right husband. Good options include Virion,
who can pass down Bowbreaker (an obvious boon to flying classes), Gregor for
access to Armsthrift and Axefaire, or Vaike for access to Axefaire. As an
alternative, consider pairing Cherche with a mage who can boost Gerome's Magic
and healing potential, and turn Gerome into a War Monk.

Henry is in my opinion the better of the two first-generation Dark Mages, since
he has access to the Barbarian line, and Wrath is very useful if he's going to
Nosferatu-tank. He has surprisingly high Strength growth for a mage, so he is a
viable candidate for physical attack if you want to switch him over. Make sure
you pick up Lifetaker if you plan to use him, and spend some time in the Thief
line to help his mobility. Since he doesn't have access to Armsthrift, don't
expect those valuable Dark tomes to hold up too long.

Henry's best wives have access to Galeforce and Armsthrift, namely Cordelia, as
their child will then be able to fulfill the role of Nosferatu-tank. However,
since Henry can pass down Lifetaker, any wife who grants Galeforce should be
fine; the merits are the Galeforce + Lifetaker combo speak for themselves.
Avoid having him marry Tharja; his poor luck coupled with limited class options
will greatly cripple their daughter Noire. He also makes a fantastic wife for
Maribelle and Sumia.

With access to both the Myrmidon and Pegasus Knight lines, it's a pity that
Say'ri cannot have children. Her base stats are solidly average, as are her
growth rates. Although she's not terrible, she suffers from lack of access to
Armsthrift and any self-recovery skills. She can work well as a supporting unit
if you pair her up with someone who needs a Speed boost, or if you put her into
a flying class, she can be used to finish off weakened enemies.

Despite having decent class options, lack of support options hurts her. She is
not able to have any kids, so there's really no need to use her. Say'ri is just
too average to rise out of the mediocrity; she just doesn't shine as bright as
many of your other options.

Tiki is very similar to Nowi, except for that she joins much, much later, and
has higher growths. Unlike Nowi, however, she has limited Support options,
especially when considering that Anna and Say'ri are unlikely to be in your
late-game party.

If you choose to use her, have her pick up Lifetaker so she has a recovery
skill. Finish her out as a Manakete or as a Wyvern Lord. Alternatively, you
could use her as a Bride (obtained through the Smash Brethren 2 DLC), since
there's no other real use for her.

Tiki cannot have any children.

Basilio is one of two late-game units you get in case your party is horribly
underleveled for the endgame, the other being Flavia. While he is decent and
can hold his own in a fight, he should be outclassed by the majority of your
party if you've been diligent about completing Paralogues and whatnot.

Furthermore, his only support option is Flavia. He does get access to Sol from
the Hero class and Lifetaker from the Dark Knight class, which helps his
survivability considerably. If you plan on using him, get him Sol, Lifetaker,
Axefaire, and Wrath, then finish him in the Warrior, Hero, or Berserker class.

Flavia joins your party at the same time as Basilio, and serves a very similar
purpose. In some ways she is superior to Basilio; the Thief line gives her nice
mobility and support options, and she gets Armsthrift as well.

However, like Basilio, she suffers from very limited support options, and is
probably outclassed by the rest of your party by the time you get her. She also
cannot have any children.

Second Generation Characters     [2GEN]
=======================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES ON SECOND GENERATION CHARACTERS
-------------------------------------

1) Second generation characters inherit base stats, stat growths, class
options, and the last skill in their parents' skill list.

2) Because of this, second generation characters are considerably more powerful
than their first generation counterparts.

3) Many second generation characters who would be otherwise mediocre can be
greatly improved by careful selection of their parents.

4) As stated, children inherit base stats from their parents.
The formula is as follows:

     [(MC - MB) + (FC - FB) + (CL)]/3 + (CC) = Child's Actual Base Stats

Where MC is the mother's current stats and MB is the mother's base stats, FC is
the father's current stats and FB is the father's base stats, CL is the child's
listed base stats, and CC is the child's class base stats. See the section on
calculating base stats for a complete list of all the class base stats.

5) Children also inherit stat growths from their parents. The formula is as
follows:

              (MG + FG + CG)/3 = Child's Actual Growth Rates

Where MG is the mother's growth rates, FG is the father's growth rates, and CG
is the child's growth rates which are listed in this guide.

6) Likewise, children inherit their Maximum Stat Modifiers (MSMs) from their
parents as well. The formula is below:

For any given stat: (Father's MSM + Mother's MSM + 1) = Child's MSM

So, as an example, let's say Chrom marries Sumia. Their modifiers are below:


          Chrom's MSMs:
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | +1  |     | +1  | +1  | +1  | -1  | -1  |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


          Sumia's MSMs:
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | -2  |     | +2  | +3  |     | -2  | +1  |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

So, by combining those and adding +1, we get...

          Cynthia's MSMs:
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          | Str | Mag | Skl | Spd | Lck | Def | Res |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
          |     | +1  | +4  | +5  | +2  | -2  | +1  |
          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Lucina is a first recruitable second-generation character, and she doesn't
disappoint. As Chrom's daughter, she starts out with Aether, and as long as you
don't choose Sully as her mother, she will also have access to Galeforce. When
you get her at the end of Chapter 13, having a character with Aether and
Galeforce is just ridiculously overpowered. Lucina has solid growth rates, and
although she'll need a little bit of training to get up to speed, she will
probably end up as one of your most dependable units, especially since she
comes equipped with an unbreakable Parallel Falchion sword.

Her very high Luck gain makes her a prime candidate for Armsthrift, but the
only potential mother who can pass down access to it is a Female Avatar. With
that said, she already has an unbreakable weapon, so don't feel like you have
to marry Chrom to the Avatar. Using Maribelle as her mother is another fine
option, which will also turn Brady into a potential powerhouse as well (due to
access to Rightful King). The only pairing I would avoid is Sully, as then
neither Kjelle nor Lucina will have access to reliable recovery skills or
Galeforce.

Like all children (unless married to the Avatar), Lucina cannot have kids. She
is blessed with many good support options, however.

Recommended Skill (Mother): Galeforce
Recommended Skill (Father): Aegis

Explanation:

Your Avatar serves as the best parent for just about ANY child, however this
one gets special mention. Lucina, who already can get Aether and Rightful King,
also gets access to every other skill in the game, meaning that she can fill
whatever role you want. Morgan becomes Lucina's brother, and then benefits from
Rightful King himself. This also means that if you take the time to train your
Avatar before Chapter 13, Lucina can start off with Galeforce. If you have a
Female Avatar, this is probably the route you should go.

Explanation:

"The supposed canon mother of Lucina is pretty good. Since Cynthia is an
unscrewable child thanks to Sumia's innate class set, her sister gets to be
part of that brokeness. Lucina gets a modest +1 in MAG with powerful mods in
+4 SKL and +5 SPD. In terms of classes, Lucina gets the Priest General, and
Pegasus Knight branch, which pretty much means she can play a full offensive
game as a Dark Flier or a Sage. However, one shouldn't overlook the defensive
set she can obtain as Lucina gets access to Pavise to complete a hyper-tank
set. You can't go wrong with this pairing at all as you have options for a
set." -Dragonboy86

Additional Class Lines Gained: Myrmidon, Pegasus Knight
Recommended Skill (Mother): Galeforce
Recommended Skill (Father): Aegis

Explanation:

"I remember when this board was saying that this pairing was the most optimal
pairing, but for who exactly? Inigo or Lucina? Well, I'm not gonna debate that,
but what I am going to tell you is what she gets out of this pairing. In terms
of stats, they are pretty rounded. +2 STR, +1 MAG, +3 SKL/SPD with -1 DEF/RES
to compensate. In terms of classes, she gets some nifty classes to play with
via Myrmidon branch and Pegasus Knight Branch. She can still play a Magical
unit via Dark Flier, but she won't have Tomefaire if that bums you out.
However, she can play physical support thanks to access to Swordfaire and with
some classes that can use it. Lastly, any Mother that can provide Galeforce is
a godsend, but Olivia is the only mother outside MU to let Lucina play her
innate Archer class properly thanks to a positive STR mod. Overall, a
physically strong Lucina that can play well to her strengths." -Dragonboy86

Owain, with his relatively high growth in both Strength and Magic, comes with
everything he needs to be a pretty awesome Dread Fighter. If you can, try to
make his father someone who can pass down access to the Mercenary line, as his
high Luck does wonders with Armsthrift. Ensure that he inherits Galeforce from
Lissa, as he is unable to learn it on his own.

If you don't want to use Male Avatar, Gregor, or Donnel as his father, then
consider either Henry or Ricken to boost his Magic and give him access to
Lifetaker. Or, hook Lissa up with Frederick or Stahl to turn Owain into a
competant cavalry unit with a wide range of class options.

Explanation:

"A relatively new pairing and people are calling it his most optimal pairing
yet. Despite the overlap in Sage, he still gets access to Luna, Dual Guard+,
and Aegis. However, it's not just the classes that make this pairing strong;
It's the mods. +4 MAG is VERY good and it lets him play any magical role
pretty damn well. Sadly, he is mostly relegated to Sage if he wants to do
anything cuz that -3 STR really hurts any potential as a physical unit, but
hey, it's all about optimization and we don't need to have fun /sarcasm."

pretty good. In terms of classes, HUGE CLASS OVERLAP, but he does get access to
Sorcerer and with innate access to Vantage, he can play a high risk, high

stuff out of the way. Mods are average, mostly bordering into negative with +1
MAG, but with +6 LCK, which can be ignored for the most part. In terms of
classes, Owain gets access Mercenary and Sol, which means Armsthrift and Sol
respectively. With Vantage, you get the best defensive set in the game. Also,
with Armsthrift, you can finally use Astra without wasting any weapon, which
means Owain gets to flex that Sword Hand as much as he pleases." -Dragonboy86

Inigo in many ways is like a more physical version of Owain. Due to poor Magic
growth, he makes a lousy Dread Fighter unless his father is a magic-user, and
even then, it's a stretch. But as a physical fighters go, Inigo is tough to
beat. He starts with automatic access to Armsthrift and Sol, and his mother
Olivia can (and should) pass him down Galeforce. He also gets access to the
Barbarian and Myrmidon lines, so he can specialize and become and Axe- or
Sword-wielding powerhouse.

Inigo's father should play to his strengths or complement his weaknesses. He
can benefit greatly from access to another recovery skill other than Sol, and
if he can get access to the Dark Mage class, his hit rate penalties from the
Barbarian line will be offset. That would mean marrying Olivia to Henry. You
can also use Inigo's father to give him access to even more physical classes by
choosing Frederick, Stahl, or Virion. No matter what, Inigo has a massive
amount of potential since he can inherit Galeforce and has access to the
Mercenary line.

father. For mods, Chrom offers them in a relatively balanced +1 across the
board sans magic while offering a -1 towards his defenses with an overall
-2...WHO CARES? This Inigo is meant to be an offensive juggernaut. In terms of
classes, Inigo gets some really good classes to play with. Great Knight is good
as usual with Luna and Dual Guard+ and thanks to Rightful King, Snipers can
safely pick apart opponents with an Astra Build or a Luna build to destroy
their defenses. Also, he gets Paladin for a more balanced approach to support
while Berserker support gets better with Aegis as an option. Lastly, Lethality
becomes a great option as Assassin or Snipers have the SKL to pull it off
alongside Rightful King." -Dragonboy86

Additional Class Lines Gained: Wyvern Rider, Mage
Recommended Skill (Mother): Galeforce
Recommended Skill (Father): Lifetaker

Explanation:

Virion is looked down as a crap father for most kids, but for Inigo, he offers
really good mods. A +3 SPD and SKL is nothing to sneeze at (though -3 in DEF
is a little disheartening). Access to Wyvern tree gives him very great
potential as a physical support while the Mage tree gives him potential to be
Magic support. Archer Tree gives him great potential to be a long distance
attacker since Snipers get access to Double/Long bow. In terms of pure damage,
unless you are doing a specialized Astra build, this Inigo will struggle in
TSON because of Pavise+ and/or Aegis+ enemies, though having a Support that
helps him activate Astra more/more attack is definitely a welcome ally. Lastly,
he has innate access to one of best Tanking sets in the game thanks to
Vantage/Sol. One of Inigo's best fathers after Chrom." -Dragonboy86

Additional Class Lines Gained: Priest, Mage, Dark Mage
Recommended Skill (Mother): Galeforce
Recommended Skill (Father): Vengeance

Explanation:

"This may be a strange pairing, but it works rather well. Mods aren't very much
to write about, but +1 MAG and 2+ SKL is not bad at all. Also, Libra gives
Inigo a more reliable way to deal damage and that is through Vengeance.
Vengeance is definitely a great skill since it has a very high activation rate
when SKL is maxed. It may force Inigo to play a High Risk/High Reward game, but
IMO, it has a great payout. However, Inigo gets a couple of classes to play
around in. War Monk is a nice way to support a mixed attacker (like Dread
Fighters) while providing a little healing. Sorcerer is always nice since Inigo
has an innate Vantage/Sol/Armsthrift going on with him. Sage is better for a
little more magic or Dark Fighter support. With this in mind, Libra is an often
overlooked father that shouldn't be underestimated." -Dragonboy86

While Brady's Cavalier and Priest lines are not nearly as useful as his mother
Maribelle's Troubadour and Pegasus Knight classes, he can still be a very solid
character if his father is chosen correctly. Maribelle should definitely pass
down Galeforce to him, since he is unable to learn it himself. Brady can pick
up Renewal, Lifetaker, and Tomefaire on his own.

Marrying Maribelle to Gregor or Donnel will give Brady access to the Mercenary
line, which means he'll be able to take advantage of Armsthrift (very helpful,
given his high Luck). However, Donnel has the ability to pass down Pegasus
Knight line access to his daughters, and that should not be wasted on a son.
The same is true of Gaius. Chrom can pass down Rightful King to him, but since
Brady would have very few activation skills, it would be mostly wasted.
Although Gregor is the strongest non-Avatar candidate, most of the potential
fathers of Brady should be fine.

makes for a fast and pretty hard-hitting ranged (magical) support unit.

Explanation:

Opens up some nice physical options for Brady, including Sol, Vantage, and
access to the Berserker, Hero, and Warrior classes. While Brady will not have
as high as Strength stat as some of your other physical attackers, he benefits
greatly from what he already inherits, especially Luna and Galeforce. Makes a
great hit-and-run support unit. Also very good as a War Monk with Galeforce,
Luna, Dual Guard+, and Axefaire.

Kjelle is the only child who starts with 4 class lines before taking the father
into account. With automatic access to both Aegis and Pavise, she can serve as
a solid tank if her father boosts her defensive stats (Frederick, Donnel, or
Stahl). However, Frederick and Stahl don't give her much as far as additional
options; their contributions are pretty much in the form of stats and growths
alone. Donnel, on the other hand, will pass down access to the Mercenary line
which is great for Armsthrift and Sol, and more importantly, will allow Kjelle
to use the Pegasus Knight line (and therefore, Galeforce). Gaius will also
allow Kjelle access to Galeforce, but not the Mercenary line. Chrom can be
Kjelle's father, but there are much better options for Chrom's wife than Sully.

If you are satisfied with the class options and skills that Kjelle already has
access to, Kellam as her father can make Kjelle an extremely tough defender.
One thing to keep in mind is that by default Kjelle has no access to any self-
recovery skills, so if her father can pass down access to Sol, Renewal, or even
Lifetaker, she will be much better for it.

terms of mods, there isn't anything too notable aside from +4 LCK and +2
SPD/SKL. In terms of classes, Kjelle innately has what she needs, but Donnel
pushes it forward with the Pegasus line and Mercenary line. Access to Galeforce
allows her to play support or even a lead if need be and she can even grab
Lancefaire if she wants to be General or even a Bride for balanced Defenses and
in tandem with Armsthrift, she can use Gravidus to its fullest potential. A
very versatile pairing in terms class access." -Dragonboy86

          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Additional Class Lines Gained: Thief, Pegasus Knight, Mage
Recommended Skill (Mother): Aegis
Recommended Skill (Father): Counter

Explanation:

"This pairing definitely overlaps with Myrmidon, but the real crux of this set
is the Pegasus line she inherits from Gaius. In terms of mods, she gets a +1
STR and a real sweet +5 in SPD/SKL. In terms of classes, access to Galeforce
is good, but the mods are what really sets apart Gaius!Kjelle from
Donnel!Kjelle. Thanks to that, she can arguably run Falcon Knight thanks to
her SPD and access to Lancefaire, which is a little better than Dark Flier in
this case since she doesn't have access to Tomefaire. However, it is your call
in the end. However, if you are looking for something a little more hard
hitting, she can run Wyvern Lord instead of Falcon Rider; It's just that Falcon
Rider offers to a little more useful stat boosts than Wyvern Lord, but it
depends if you supporting a Physical Lead or a Magical Lead. Lastly, she can
still grab Sol via inheritance since Fighter is gender exclusive, which still
lets you be a tank if you choose to do so. Again, another powerful, yet
underrated pairing. Also, it's kind of funny that almost the roles she can
take are on horseback with this pairing...maybe it's just me?" -Dragonboy86

Additional Class Lines Gained: Thief, Mercenary
Recommended Skill (Mother): Aegis
Recommended Skill (Father): Axefaire/Counter

Explanation:

"After the Donnel!Kjelle craze was over, someone suggested that Vaike!Kjelle
was the best non-sorcerer Tank in the game. What makes this pairing so special?
First off, She gets +3 STR, and +4 SPD/SKL. Next, while Vaike's Knight is
wasted on her, she still gets Mercenary out of the deal and even gets Assassin
if she wants to play support. However, this pairing's claim to fame is Kjelle's
ability to tank. Thanks to innate PavGis and high SKL mod, Kjelle will be
tanking hits like no tomorrow. Also, she can inherit Axefaire, which means her
tank abilities as a Hero go up a bit since she can use the Helswath instead of
Ragnell. Still, with the release of Apotheosis and people finally playtesting
their builds, many are starting to wonder if tanking is worth the effort in
Apotheosis given the high stats of its enemies. However, if you like tanking,
this is a pairing that you shouldn't look over." -Dragonboy86

Cynthia starts already having access to the Pegasus Knight line, as well as
access to a recovery skill through Renewal (in the Cleric line). Don't waste
Gaius on her as he is capable of passing down the Pegasus Knight line, which
Cynthia already gets. She can potentially be Chrom's daughter, but Chrom is
often better served in another marriage. In my opinion, the strongest choice
for Cynthia's father is Henry, as he can pass down Lifetaker, as well as give
Sumia access to the Dark Mage and Thief lines. The only four options are Chrom,
Gaius, Frederick, and Henry. If you already chose Henry's wife, Frederick or
Chrom are viable alternatives.

Make sure Cynthia spends some time as General to help with her rather mediocre
Strength stat. She has the potential to be a strong and fast offensive tool.

selection, it's okay mostly because Cynthia has all that she needs from her
mother. Though she does get Valkyrie, which means she can pull off support

selections, however, she gets plenty. She gets the full Pavise/Aegis combo

being +1, but a heavy lose in -2 MAG. In terms of class, she gets access to the
Pavise/Aegis combo and gets the Wyvern Rider Tree, which is a great defensive
support class. I don't like this pairing very much mostly cuz it reduces
Cynthia's favorite stats, which SPD and MAG. With this Cynthia, you're pretty
much bound to either a Physical Tank set or Support Set cuz Dark Flier's MAG
and SPD go down too harshly to be useable. You can try it, but you will notice
the drop in power compared to other classes. However, this is her best father
if she wants to do Bride Support for Sorcerer or any other Magical class as she
has some of the stats to back it up." -Dragonboy86

Severa is one of the more frustrating children to recruit, especially on higher
difficulties. Make sure you send some high-mobility units to go clear a path
for her, and try and block her access to the edge of the wall where ranged foes
can take potshots at her.

However, she is absolutely worth it. As one of the stronger children due to
amazing default class options, she can already fill several different roles.
Because she starts with access to the Mercenary line for Armsthrift and Sol,
the Pegasus Knight line for Galeforce, and the Dark Mage line for Lifetaker and
Nosferatu access, she can make a fantastic Nosferatu tank if her father is a
magic-user and has high Luck.  If you go that route, Ricken is probably your
best option since he will give her a much-appreciated Luck boost. Henry and
Libra are respectable options as well, boosting her Magic growth rates
(although they don't help much in the Luck category).

Another solid option is to make Cordelia's father a strong physical fighter,
such as Kellam. Since she already has awesome skill options, she can become a
front-liner and after a little bit of training will be pretty much self-
sufficient. Kellam has the added bonus of giving her access to three more class
options: Knight, Thief, and Cleric. No matter who you choose, Severa will be a
solid addition to any team.

Explanation:

"Most people call this Severa's best pairing and for VERY good reasons. Access
to Luna, Vengeance, Vantage, Sol, and Aegis, this Severa has a lot of what she
wants in skills. +3 STR in mods is pretty good, with her worst mod being -3 in
LCK (Limit Break don't care about that). This Severa is definitely designed to
be a frontline Menace a Hero. A Sorcerer build is not out of the question since
she has Armsthrift and Luna to deal damage (though it's hard to raise that
MAG). However, that doesn't mean she has to be Frontliner. She definitely has
classes and skills that can help her in support. With Dual Guard+ and
Swordfaire/Bowfaire/Lancefaire, an Assassin or Paladin build make a great
support for a Physical Attacker with Galeforce (though no aggressor makes it
iffy). With inherent Galeforce, she can earn in extra kill her for her partner.
Definitely a top-tier pairing with many options." -Dragonboy86

particular in terms of skills and classes (except for the Thief Tree), but his
Mods are where it's at. Leaving her at only -1 MAG makes her good, but the loss
of Luna and the her 2 RES/DEF stats make it hard to like this pairing since she

don't care about doubling, you'll still be able to wreck everything else not
named Anna and TSON Sniper. Plus, it makes her Sorcerer class a little more
viable, but no Pavise or Vantage means you have to be careful with tanking.
Lastly, Ricken is wanted by others so someone else like Owain may be more
deserving of Ricken. Still a nice option to have in your pocket if you... don't
need to put Ricken somewhere else." -Dragonboy86

Cherche's son Gerome is one of the few male children who cannot under any
circumstances get Galeforce, which hurts him badly. However, he can make up for
it if you pair Cherche up with the right husband. Good options include Virion,
who can pass down Bowbreaker (an obvious boon to flying classes), Gregor for
access to Armsthrift and Axefaire, or Vaike for access to Axefaire. As an
alternative, consider pairing Cherche with a mage who can boost Gerome's Magic
and healing potential, and turn Gerome into a War Monk.

Explanation:

"You can argue that Gregor is the middle man between Stahl and Vaike. In mods,
+5 ATK and +3 DEF is pretty damn good. While he doesn't get Dual Guard+,
Pavise, or Aegis, he does get Armsthrift and Axefaire. Axefaire and Armsthrift
is everything Gerome could want as a supporter. Continous use of Helswath in
Dual Strikes is definitely welcome. Also, he gets Vantage/Sol and when combined
with Axefaire and Armsthrift, you get a Tank that hit can heal moderately
well." -Dragonboy86

Explanation:

"I would argue that this is Gerome's best father because Frederick can make him
one of the best supporters OR a potential Frontliners. In terms of notable
mods, a [+6] ATK is the most beautiful mod he gets with a [+5] DEF trailing not
so far behind... In classes, he gets the Knight and Cavelier line, which means
the Pavise/Aegis combo is available. Add Luna into the mix and you got a Tank
that can hit back pretty damn hard. With a Galeforce lead, take down the enemy
and switch to Gerome to tank a few things." -Dragonboy86

Explanation:

"A once popular pairing that has fallen out of grace mostly because of class
overlap and the popularity of Vaike! Kjelle. However, it's still a good pairing
in terms of mods. A +7 ATK is nothing to scoff at, but not much else is
notable. In terms of classes, Gerome gets Axefaire, which ups his attack a bit.
However, unlike Frederick! Gerome, he can't play a frontline role. Still a good
pairing IMO." -Dragonboy86

Yarne, like Gerome, is also unable to get Galeforce under any circumstances. He
is very much like his mother Panne: Yarne can serve as a decent lockpicker, and
can be useful against enemy riders do to the super-effective damage that the
Taguel-specific skill Beastbane gives, but that's about it.

Taguels aren't really terrible, they're just outclassed by their Manakete
cousins, and by... well, pretty much everyone else.

His best fathers are Donnel, Gregor, and Vaike, but they are probably best
served elsewhere (Donnel and Gregor especially). Marry Panne to one of your
leftover potential fathers, just for completion's sake.

Additional Class Lines Gained: Mercenary, Myrmidon
Recommended Skill (Mother): Swordbreaker

Explanation:

"Gregor is a great father for kids with Access to Sorcerer, but let's not
pretend that Gregor's mods are suited for Sorcerer kids. Gregor is
statistically better for Physical kids and that's where Yarne comes in. For his
mods, he gets a sweet +5 ATL, a +5 SKL, and a +4 SPD. As for classes, he gets
the Myrmidon and Mercenary tree. Yarne becomes a very potent support. He
appreciates Armsthrift as he can abuse Helswath to its max potential and
thanks to innate access to Axefaire, he is gonna hit hard. While Myrmidon is a
little less than stellar, it does mean he gets Swordfaire and access to
Assassin, which is a powerful support class. Lastly, he does get the rare
Trickster class, allowing him to play a magic support class or you can opt for
a Dread Fighter Support to help your Physical lead with their RES. However,
playing a tank build is not out of the question as he gets Sol and Vantage
along with Armsthrift. Overall, one Yarne's most powerful options as a father."

Explanation:

"Frederick is a heavily contested father for a lot of children and based on all
the topics I've done thus far, I'd argue that Yarne is in the top 3 for
Frederick as a Father. For mods, They are pretty good. +5 ATK, +5 SKL, +4 DEF
and +2 SPD with only -2 MAG. As for classes, Not only does he offer a powerful
support skill in Dual Guard+ to accompany the innate axefaire, Frederick always
grants his children with the PavGis combo, letting Yarne take the role as a
powerful tank. With either General to help up your SKL to Proc your PavGis,
Wyvern Lord to to help with mobility, or Dread Fighter for balanced defenses,
you have plenty of options for tanking." -Dragonboy86

Recommended Skill (Father): Tomefaire/Bowfaire

Explanation:

"A really strange pairing, but one that definitely works. +2 in STR and MAG
let's you pick magic or physical support. Also, +4 SPD and +3 SKL really works.
As for classes, he does gets access to 3/5 -faires thanks to this pairing
(Tomefaire, Axefaire, and Bowfaire). He also gets access Dual Guard+ to
compensate for no Armthrift, which is perfect for a support unit like him.
Innate access to Assassin lets him put his Bowfaire to use while Tomefaire
allows him to play Sage support or even Dread Fighter support. Overall, not a
bad pairing." -Dragonboy86

Laurent is potentially one of the best Nosferatu-tanks in the game, because he
has access to Tomefaire, Lifetaker, and Dark tomes while in the Sorcerer class.
However, he lacks access to Armsthrift. Marry Miriel to Gregor or Donnel to fix
this. If you marry her to Donnel, Laurent will benefit from extremely high luck
and stat growths, but since Donnel is able to pass down Pegasus Knight line
access to his daughters, you may be better off with Gregor.

Another viable alternative would be to marry Miriel to someone like Kellam, who
will boost Laurent's physical survivability. However, he then goes without
Armsthrift. It should also be noted that since Laurent is unable to get
Galeforce under any circumstances, his best role is that of a Nosferatu-tank.

First off, the mods sort of conflict, but they work themselves out nicely. He
still retains a +3 MAG with a respectable +4 SKL. He also gets a usable +1 STR
(though he looks weird in a physical class because of the hat...dat freaking
hat). In terms of classes, there is Barbarian overlap, but he gets Mercenary
and Myrmidon, which is all the he needs for the most part. He gets the infamous
Armsthrift Sorcerer set and he even gets a complete VVW set. There isn't much
else to say other than this is a powerful set." -Dragonboy86

Additional Class Lines Gained: Cavalier, Archer
Recommended Skill (Mother): Dual Support+
Recommended Skill (Father): Tomefaire

Explanation:

"Before you all chew me out for the overlap, hear me out. This is was my
pairing for my first playthrough and it's really effective at what he does. For
the mods, the only mod that matters in this pairing is the +6 MAG. Why? because
this is most likely the most powerful magical support character in the game.
Access to Dual Guard+ and Dual Support+ is pretty good and thanks to innate
access to Tomefaire and Aggressor, his Dual Strikes will hurt pretty damn hard.
Sucks he doesn't have a chance to frontline since he only has access to Aegis
(if he had Pavise, he would have a chance). Many would argue that this a waste
of Ricken, but if he is played to his strengths, you won't be disappointed."

As Gaius's daughter, she can inherit Sol, which is always helpful. However, as
Donnel's daughter, she gets access to the Mercenary line for Armthrift and Sol,
as well as being able to inherit Aptitude from Donnel, which turns her into a
formidable Nosferatu-tank.

"This pairing has a lot of versatility in terms of skills and classes. She can
definitely play support or frontliner with the stuff she gets from Gaius. In
terms of mods, she gets +3 SPD and a +2 MAG, and 1+STR, which is some pretty
good distribution. As for skills, she gets innate Luna and Dual guard while she
can get Vantage from the Myrmidon Tree, which lets her do the infamous Sorcerer
Tank build. Lastly, she gets Sol/Counter from Gaius if he passes it down. As
for builds, you can do any Physical, Magic, or support build since Gaius offers
a lot of class distribution and good mods, but a couple of your builds will
depend on what you pass down from Gaius so choose wisely." -Dragonboy86

Nah is at her best when Gaius or Donnel are her father, since she then becomes
a Manakete with access to the Galeforce-Lifetaker combo. Gaius is probably the
better choice overall, since Armsthrift is mostly wasted on Manakete. She also
greatly enjoys the added mobility that access to the Thief line gives her. If
her father is a Male Avatar, then Nah will have access to every regular class,
and Morgan will be able to become a Manakete.

If none of those options float your boat, then make Nah the daughter of someone
like Vaike, who will boost her already impressive Strength, or Kellam, who will
do the same for her Defense.

class, Nah does get access to Dark Flier, which means Magic support.
Unfortunately, most Galeforce units come with a Luna one way or another. Nah is
not one of those galeforcers, but she does get Astra to compensate, which isn't
that bad. It's just not as reliable. However, Gaius can pass on Sol, which
means you can do a manakete tank set. Lastly, Nah does get Assassin and with
Swordfaire, so she can become a pretty good physical supporter. Pretty much an
all-around pairing." -Dragonboy86

"Another "best" pairing. In mods, +7 DEF is nothing to scoff at all. She has a
respectable +3 in REs and STR, though much like Frederick, -3 SPD is a little
iffy, but negligible. In terms of classes, it's almost the same except you get
Thief and Priest instead Cavelier. A Manakete build is definitely the best
build for since any other one would kind of suck. While I argue that Frederick
is better, Kellam does give her Renewal, which gives Nah a more reliable
healing option. A good pairing I suppose, but I don't like it cuz you don't get
full coverage on defense. Beggars can't be choosers I suppose." -Dragonboy86

Recommended Skill (Mother): Swordbreaker
Recommended Skill (Father): Ignis

Explanation:

The only downside to this pairing is that your Avatar can only marry once! Nah
will gain access to Galeforce and the Tactician line, and Morgan will be able
to become a Manakete. Turns both Nah and Morgan into real powerhouses. Probably
my favorite overall pairing for a Male Avatar.

It should be noted that if Morgan is the child of the Avatar and one of the
other second generation characters, Morgan will NOT benefit from the additional
+1 maximum stat modifier.

Weapon Rank(s):
Depends on Starting Class


Morgan is, without a doubt, the most versatile character in the game. Having
access to every single regular class, he/she can be loaded with whatever skills
you want, and fulfill just about any role.

You can even turn Morgan into a Taguel or Manakete if your Avatar marries Panne
or Nowi/Tiki, respectively. Morgan can also inherit exclusive skills, such as
Rightful King and Aether from Chrom or Lucina, Shadowgift from Aversa, and
Conquest from Walhart.

Because of this, you should carefully select your Avatar's spouse. If your
Avatar is female, both your Avatar and Morgan will be able to get Galeforce
(Avatar through Dark Flier class, Morgan through inheritance). No matter whom
you choose as Morgan's other parent, Morgan will be a force to be reckoned
with.

My personal favorite combination is Avatar + Aversa, since Shadowgift allows
Morgan to use Dark tomes even when outside of the Dark Mage/Sorcerer class.
This means that as long as Morgan can use regular tomes (such as in the Dark
Knight or Dark Flier class), he will be able to Nosferatu-tank. Furthermore,
because he/she automatically has access to Armsthrift (and everything else),
Morgan is definitely the best Nosferatu-tank in the game. Well, honestly,
Morgan is the best at everything in the game.

Just be aware that Morgan cannot become a Dancer, Lord, or Conquerer (although
their skills can be inherited).

I don't want to simply rehash everything I said in Lucina's entry, but it all

Rightful King through inheritance. See [LUCI] above for more details.

Additional Class Lines Gained: Villager
Recommended Skill (Mother): Galeforce
Recommended Skill (Father): Aptitude

Explanation:

Nice because Morgan can take advantage of Aptitude. This is really a
combination meant for casual players who do not intend to fully optimize their
party, and simply want to get through the main story-line without grinding a
great deal. For players who are a bit beyond casual, avoid this option as
Donnel is one of the few husbands who can pass down Pegasus Knight line access,
which is wasted here.

Explanation:

If you don't mind waiting till the VERY end of the game, this is a great

you plan to put Morgan into a heavy physical class like Great Knight.

Explanation:

Another great pairing for a Male Avatar, as Morgan will be able to get Aether
as well as increased MSMs. However, this means that only your Avatar and Morgan
will have access to the Tactician line, and all available classes by gender.

Recommended Skill (Mother): Shadowgift
Recommended Skill (Father): Axefaire or Counter

Explanation:

Much like Walhart, a great pairing if you don't mind waiting until the VERY end
of the main story to get it. This pairing is good for Aversa's unique skill
Shadowgift, which allows Tome-wielders to use Dark Tomes outside of the Dark
Mage and Sorcerer class.

Weapon Rank(s):

Gangrel is a very average Trickster, and the first of the Spotpass characters.
He has slightly above-average growths in HP, Strenth, Skill, and Speed.
Although he has access to a handful of decent skills, such as Lifetaker,
Axefaire, and Assassinate, most of them do not complement each other very well.
His best role is that of an Assassin.

Walhart is the only Conquerer in the game, and he is an offensive behemoth. He
hits incredibly hard due to his exceptional Strength, and he can absorb hits
due to his high HP and Defense. His unique skill Conquest negates his weakness
to weapons such as Hammers and Rapiers.

However, he suffers from lack of access to recovery and offensive skills, as
well as from lack of access to Armsthrift. Also, like all Spotpass characters,
his support options are limited to the Avatar.

If married to a Female Avatar, Walhart is capable of passing down Conquest to
Morgan.

Emmeryn joins your party as a Sage, and she's somewhat useful because of her
access to the Pegasus Knight line. She makes a decent Dark Flier or Valkyrie.

However, like all Spotpass characters, she joins too late to really do you a
lot of good, and she should easily be outclassed by your other healers, such as
Maribelle.

Aversa starts with reasonably high base stats, solid growths, and decent class
options. However, the best thing about her is her Shadowgift skill: it allows
her to use Dark tomes even outside of the Sorcerer class. This skill can be
inherited by Morgan if you wait and marry Aversa to a Male Avatar.

If you intend to use Aversa, have her pick up Lifetaker from the Dark Knight
class, as it's really the only decent skill she's missing that she can actually
get. You can also have her pick up Lancefaire, but most of her damage should
be magical so that's up to you.

Priam is the final Spotpass character, and he is an animal. He starts with all
of the -breaker skills except for Tomebreaker and Bowbreaker, and by switching
to the Bow Knight class, he can get the latter of the two.

He also should spend some time as a Mercenary and pick up Armsthrift, so that
his unique weapon Ragnell can be preserved.

He has high base stats, and is fairly self-sufficient thanks to Sol. However,
by the time you get him, he may be outclassed by your other party members.

======================
Skill Guide     [SKLL]
======================

NOTES ON SKILLS AND CLASSES
---------------------------

1) Basic classes learn one skill at Level 1, and a second skill at Level 10.

2) Second-tier advanced classes learn one skill at Level 5, and a second skill
at Level 15.

3) Unique classes like Manakete and Dread Fighter learn one skill at Level 1,
and one skill at Level 15.

4) Some skills are much better than others, and some are better served equipped
to certain characters.

5) Unlike previous Fire Emblem titles like Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and
Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, skills cannot be removed and placed into your
inventory for anyone to use. Every given character has their own skill list,
which grows through training, inheritance, or use of DLC-exclusive items.

6) There is a much better and more detailed skill guide available at GameFAQs,
written by guedesbrawl. The skills section in this guide is meant to be more of
a "quick-reference" guide. For more information and a more detailed analysis of
each skill, please consult guedesbrawl's Skill FAQ.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Dual Strike+]

Explanation: Increases Dual Strike rate by 10%.

Activation: When paired up.

Learned By
----------
Class: Lord
Level: 1

A fairly useful skill for Chrom, Lucina, and Morgan (if son of Chrom), since
they often spend most of their time paired up.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Charm]

Explanation: Gives +5 Hit Rate/Avoid to all allies within 3 spaces.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Lord
Level: 10

This skill is kind of beneficial in the early game, but should be replaced as
better skills are learned.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Aether]

Explanation: Attacks twice, first with Sol and then with Luna.

Activation: (Skill Stat/2)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Great Lord
Level: 5

A very powerful skill, but doesn't activate as reliably as I'd like. Having
Rightful King helps, though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rightful King]

Explanation: Increases all skill activation rates by 10%.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Great Lord
Level: 15

An extremely useful skill. Especially awesome when passed down to Morgan as
Chrom's son, who has the class and skill options to really abuse it. Great for
the Aegis/Pavise combo, or for stacking different activation skills like Luna
and Aether. Best when combined with multi-stike weapons such as a Brave Sword
or Celica's Gale.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Veteran]

Explanation: Gain 150% of normal experience when paired up.

Activation: When paired up.

Learned By
----------
Class: Tactician
Level: 1

One of two EXP-boosting skills in the game, Veteran is very useful for level
and skill grinding. Unfortunately, it can only be learned by your Avatar and
Morgan.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Solidarity]

Explanation: Critical Chance/Avoid +10 to adjacent allies.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Tactician
Level: 10

Quickly outclassed by the massive number of other skills Morgan and your Avatar
can learn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Ignis]

Explanation: When attacking with a physical weapon, adds (Magic Stat/2) to your
Strength stat. When attacking with a magical weapon, adds (Strength Stat/2) to
your Magic stat.

Activation: (Skill Stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Grandmaster
Level: 5

Given the jack-of-all-trades growth rates of your Avatar and Morgan, a very
useful skill. Activates fairly reliably, but the skill slot can often be used
for something better by endgame.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Spectrum]

Explanation: Increases all stats, except Movement, by +4 for all allies within
3 spaces. Lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Grandmaster
Level: 15

Arguably the best Rally skill, but by endgame, there are better uses for that
skill slot.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Discipline]

Explanation: Earn double weapon experience.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Cavalier
Level: 1

Good for quickly leveling up your weapon ranks, but should replaced once they
are high enough.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[outdoor Fighter]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate/Avoid by +10 when fighting outside.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Cavalier
Level: 10

A halfway decent skill in the early game, but should quickly be replaced by
stronger skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Defender]

Explanation: Gives +1 to all stats, except Movement, when paired up.

Activation: When paired up.

Learned By
----------
Class: Paladin
Level: 5

Useful for characters like Frederick who may spend a lot of time paired up. Not
that great of a skill for main front-liners, however.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Aegis]

Explanation: Halves damage from bows, tomes, and dragonstones.

Activation: (Skill Stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Paladin
Level: 15

Half of the mighty Aegis-Pavise defensive combo. Good for characters that are
vulnerable to bows (like fliers) or have low resistance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Luna]

Explanation: Ignore half of the enemy's Defence/Resistance stat.

Activation: (Skill Stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Great Knight
Level: 5

A useful offensive skill that is essential for taking down study enemies such
as Generals (and just about anything else). Widely regarded as one of the best
offensive skills, if not the best.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Dual Guard+]

Explanation: Increases Dual Guard chance by 10%.

Activation: (Skill Stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Great Knight
Level: 15

An extremely useful skill for characters who function paired up in a support
role, such as Frederick. Greatly helps increase survivability of partner unit,
especially at high Support levels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Defence +2]

Explanation: Increases Defence stat by +2.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Knight
Level: 1

Pretty useless compared to other skills. Replace it once you have better stuff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Indoor Fighter]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate/Avoid by +10 when fighting inside.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Knight
Level: 10

Can be useful in the early game, especially since indoor maps generally have a
a small number of choke points that you need to secure. However, it usually
gets outclassed by better skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Defence]

Explanation: Increases Defence of all allies by +4 with a 3 space radius. Lasts
until beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: General
Level: 5

A moderately useful Rally skill, especially earlier in the game when +4 Defence
is considered a lot. However, it should be replaced as better skills become
available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Pavise]

Explanation: Halves damage from swords, lances, axes, and beaststones.

Activation: (Skill Stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: General
Level: 15

The other half of the fantastic defensive Aegis-Pavise combo. Put it on your
wall characters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Avoid +10]

Explanation: Increases Avoid Rate by +10.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Myrmidon
Level: 1

Avoid rate is always useful. A good filler skill if you are lacking 5 elite
skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Vantage]

Explanation: Always attack first if your HP is less than 50%.

Activation: HP drops below 50%.

Learned By
----------
Class: Myrmidon
Level: 10

A very useful skill if you can get it on a character who can OHKO. Especially
good if combined with Wrath. Vantage can also greatly increase survivability on
tankier characters if they have Sol.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Astra]

Explanation: Attack 5 times, dealing 50% of normal damage with each hit.

Activation: (Skill Stat/2)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Swordmaster
Level: 5

Astra would be considerably more usful if its activation rate was higher. It
should be noted, even if it hits for the full 5 times, only 1 weapon usage will
be consumed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Swordfaire]

Explanation: Increases Strength by +5 when a sword is equipped.

Activation: Equipped with a sword.

Learned By
----------
Class: Swordmaster
Level: 15

+5 Damage never hurts. Also good because it combines very easily with other
skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Armsthrift]

Explanation: Weapon usage is not reduced upon a successful hit.

Activation: (Luck Stat x 2)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Mercenary
Level: 1

One of my favorite skills in the game, because it has a fantastic activation
rate (very easy to get up to 90% or higher). Essential if you want to use the
rarer high-quality weapons like Celica's Gale, Tyrfing, and Armads. A very
useful skill for any Nosferatu-tank. Does not work on Staves, unfortunately.
Also basically useless if its user is equipped with weapons that are easy to
purchase.

However, Armsthrift is a skill of convenience, if you have the Infinite Regalia
and Golden Gaffe DLC, since most of the weapons you would want to use it one
(Ragnell, Armads, etc) are obtainable through Infinite Regalia, or can be
puchased from WIFI Bonus Box teams (Celica's Gale, Brave Weapons, etc). For
that reason, many people are not as big a fan of it as myself. If you are
willing to spend a lot of time grinding the Infinite Regalia and Golden Gaffe
DLC (for Regalia weapons and massive amounts of cash needed to fully forge the
other good weapons), Armsthrift diminishes in awesomeness considerably.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Patience]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +10 during the enemies turn.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Mercenary
Level: 10

A fairly useful skill, especially if combined with Avoid +10 from the Mercenary
line. Good for increasing survivability of fast, squishy characters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Sol]

Explanation: Recover HP equal to 50% of damage dealt on a successful hit.

Activation: (Skill Stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Hero
Level: 5

Another one of the best skills in the game. Absolutely essential on higher
difficulties who need to take a lot of hits on the enemy's turn, since it is
the only skill that you can recover HP with during the enemy's turn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Axebreaker]

Explanation: Increases Avoid by +50 when the enemy is equipped with an Axe.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Hero
Level: 15

The lesser of the two Hero skills, but only because Sol is so godly. Extremely
good if it can be combined with the other -breaker skills. Also helpful for the
maps with lots of enemy Barbarians.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[HP +5]

Explanation: Increases max HP by +5.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Fighter
Level: 1

This skill is the only way to get your maximum HP above 80, but by that point
you should have much more useful skills available. Better in the early game
when 5 HP is more significant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Zeal]

Explanation: Increases Critical Rate by +5

Activation: Always On

Learned By
----------
Class: Fighter
Level: 10

If you go for a Critical build, combining this with Wrath, Gamble, and a Killer
Weapon will boost your critical hit chance to at least 55%. even better if
combined with Vantage. However, there are often better builds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Raly Strength]

Explanation: Increases Strength of all allies by +4 within a 3 space radius.
Lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Warrior
Level: 5

Can be situationally useful if there's an enemy you need just a little extra
oomph to kill. Quickly outclassed by better skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Counter]

Explanation: When fighting an adjacent enemy, deals damage to them equal to
the damage they dealt to you. Does not activate if their blow kills you.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Warrior
Level: 15

One of the most annoying skills for enemies to have. Can be useful, but not
often. Use other better skills instead. This skill is infinitely more useful in
Streetpass battles.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Despoil]

Explanation: Yields a Bullion (S) upon defeating an enemy.

Activation: (Luck Stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Barbarian
Level: 1

Very useful if you intend to do a playthrough without abusing DLC, specifically
the Golden Gaffe. If you plan to use the DLC, this skill is not nearly as good.
A Bullion (S) is worth 1000 gold.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Gamble]

Explanation: Decreases Hit Rate by -5, but increases Critical Chance by +10.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Barbarian
Level: 10

Part of the Zeal-Gamble-Wrath critical combo. Not so great by itself.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Wrath]

Explanation: Increases Critical Chance by +20 if your HP is below 50%.

Activation: HP drops below 50%.

Learned By
----------
Class: Berserker
Level: 5

Part of the Zeal-Gamble-Wrath critical combo. Also great if combined with
Vantage from the Myrmidon line, at least on paper. In reality, Critical builds
in this game are outclassed by other builds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Axefaire]

Explanation: Increases Strength by +5 when an Axe is equipped.

Activation: Equipped with an axe.

Learned By
----------
Class: Berserker
Level: 15

A good skill for all axe-wielders, since they often lack an abundance of good
skills. Unfortunately limited to males who have access to the Barbarian line
and their children through inheritance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Skill +2]

Explanation: Increases Skill stat by +2.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Archer
Level: 1

One of the more mediocre skills. Replace it once you get the chance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Prescience]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +15 during the user's turn.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Archer
Level: 10

Not nearly as good as Patience, but can be useful on your attackers with poor
Skill stats.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Hit Rate +20]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate by +20.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Sniper
Level: 5

Decent, but would be better if the characters that get it didn't already have
very high hit rates. Useful for overcoming enemy -breaker skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Bowfaire]

Explanation: Increases Strength by +5 when a bow is equipped.

Activation: Equipped with a bow.

Learned By
----------
Class: Sniper
Level: 15

Useful for your bow-using units who often can use a little extra power,
especially for Assassins.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Skill]

Explanation: Increases Skill of all allies by +4 with a 3 space radius.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Bow Knight
Level: 5

Practically useless. Replace it ASAP.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Bowbreaker]

Explanation: Increases Avoid by +50 when the enemy is equipped with a bow.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Bow Knight
Level: 15

Very useful for flying classes, such as Wyvern Lords.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Locktouch]

Explanation: Allows user to open doors and chests with the use of a key.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Thief
Level: 1

A great utility skill; there is no character who can never benefit from having
it. Just make sure it's not equipped when there are no doors or chests to open.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Movement +1]

Explanation: Increases movement range by +1.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Thief
Level: 10

An extremely useful utility skill, especially for classes who suffer from
limited mobility like Generals. Also great for Nah and the Taguel characters.
Should be used on any character who can get it who can afford the skill slot.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Lethality]

Explanation: Instantly kills the enemy.

Activation: (Skill Stat/4)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Assassin
Level: 5

Can be absolutely awesome, but its activation rate is too low to be relied upon
consistently. Good if you have no other options though, as its users will
almost always double attack, and is even better when combined with a Brave
weapon. Some enemy bosses (especially on higher difficulties) are immune to
this skill. This skill is much more useful in Streetpass battles.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Pass]

Explanation: Allows user to pass through spaces occupied by enemy units.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Assassin
Level: 15

Very useful for your lockpicking characters, or if a gap opens up in your
lines. Great when combined with Acrobat. However, it is definitely a niche
skill.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Lucky Seven]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +20 for the first 7 turns.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Trickster
Level: 5

Better than it sounds on paper, as most battles do not last too much past 7
turns. Throw it in if you have the extra space in your skill slots. This skill
is especially good in Streetpass battles.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Acrobat]

Explanation: Allows user to cross all traversable terrain without movement
penalties.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Trickster
Level: 15

Very useful for non-flying classes and classes who suffer from poor mobility.
Combine with Movement +1 for best results.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Speed +2]

Explanation: Increases Skill stat by +2.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Pegasus Knight
Level: 1

Another fairly useless stat-boosting skill. Replace it when possible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Relief]

Explanation: Recover 20% of max HP at the start of your turn, but only if there
are no other units within 3 spaces.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Pegasus Knight
Level: 10

The least reliable self-recovery skill, but it is still better than nothing.
Replace it as better skills become available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Speed]

Explanation: Increases Speed of all allies by +4 within a 3 space radius. Lasts
until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Falcon Knight
Level: 5

Another pretty mediocre Rally skill. Replace it when better skills become
available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Lancefaire]

Explanation: Increases Strength by +5 when a lance is equipped.

Activation: Equipped with a lance.

Learned By
----------
Class: Falcon Knight
Level: 15

A fairly good skill, especially since most female fliers suffer from poor
strength. Use it if you have the space.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Movement]

Explanation: Increases Movement of all allies by +1 within a 3 space radius.
Lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Dark Flier
Level: 5

Situationally useful. However, most characters who can learn this skill have
much better things to fill their skill slots with.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Galeforce]

Explanation: Allows the user to take another full action after they defeat an
enemy during the user's turn. Limited to one activation per turn.

Activation: Defeat an enemy on your turn.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dark Flier
Level: 15

In my opinion, the best skill in the game. Galeforce allows units to move and
attack twice per turn, provided that they can ORKO an enemy unit. This allows
for the faster clearing of enemies, but Galeforce really shines in the added
mobility it gives. By killing an enemy, units with a fairly standard movement
range of 8 can move as far as 16 spaces in a single turn! This also opens up
hit-and-run tactics; you can run in, attack an enemy, and retreat to a safe
distance.

To make Galeforce even better, combine it with Lifetaker (from the Dark Knight
class). Lifetaker recovers 50% of the users maximum HP upon defeating an enemy,
so if a Galeforce-Lifetaker user can reliably kill 2 enemies per turn, they are
able to recover 100% of their health per turn. The Galeforce-Lifetaker combo is
also very, very useful for taking down those annoying enemies with Counter.

Galeforce + Aggressor is also a fantastic combination, and arguably better.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Strength +2]

Explanation: Increases Strength stat by +2.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Wyvern Rider
Level: 1

A pretty mediocre stat-boosting skill. Replace it when you get better skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Tantivity]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +10 if there are no allies within
a 3 space radius.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Wyvern Rider
Level: 10

Can be reasonably useful if combined with Patience for characters who like to
go off on their own. However, usually outclassed by better skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Quick Burn]

Explanation: At the start of the battle, Hit Rate and Avoid starts at +15. The
effect decreases by -1 with every turn.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Wyvern Lord
Level: 5

Due to the fairly short number of turn numbers involved in most battles, Quick
Burn is far superior to its cousin Slow Burn. However, there are often better
skills available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Swordbreaker]

Explanation: Increases Avoid by +50 when the enemy is equipped with a sword.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Wyvern Lord
Level: 15

A fairly useful skill for axe-users who are unable to use lances. Might be
worth a skill slot if a map has lots of enemy sword-wielders.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Deliverer]

Explanation: Increases Movement by +2 when paired up. Does not increase
movement if the user is the supporting unit.

Activation: When paired up.

Learned By
----------
Class: Griffon Rider
Level: 5

Can be useful for characters who spend a lot of their time being supported by a
unit paired up with them. Useless otherwise.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Lancebreaker]

Explanation: Increases Avoid by +50 when the enemy is equipped with a lance.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Griffon Rider
Level: 15

The only reason to ever go into the Griffon Rider class, and even then its
shaky at best. This skill is most useful on sword-users who can't take a lot of
hits.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Magic +2]

Explanation: Increases Magic stat by +2.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Mage
Level: 1

Another mediocre stat-booster. Replace it when better skills become available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Focus]

Explanation: Increases Critical Chance by +10 when there are no allies within a
3 space radius.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Mage
Level: 10

Can be useful for characters who go off on their own often, but unfortunately
that will not be most mages as they are usually rather squishy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Magic]

Explanation: Increases Magic stat for all allies by +4 within a 3 space radius.
Lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Sage

Situationally useful, at best. Replace it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Tomefaire]

Explanation: Increases Magic stat by +5 when a tome is equipped.

Activation: Equipped with a tome.

Learned By
----------
Class: Sage
Level: 15

Very useful general-purpose skill for magic-users. One of the better skills to
have on a Nosferatu tank.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Hex]

Explanation: Reduces Avoid by -15 for all adjacent enemies.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dark Mage
Level: 1

Reasonably useful when combined with Anathema, especially given the poor hit
rate of Dark magic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Anethema]

Explanation: Reduces Hit Rate and Avoid by -10 for all enemies within a 3 space
radius.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dark Mage
Level: 10

Useful especially when combined with Hex, given the poor hit rate of Dark
Magic. Good throughout the game because it is an area debuff and combines
nicely with other related skills, such as Hit Rate +20.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Vengeance]

Explanation: Increases damage by (User's Max HP - User's Current HP).

Activation: (Skill Stat x 2)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Sorcerer
Level: 5

An essential skill for any Nosferatu-tank. Extremely good if combined with
Vantage from the Myrmidon class. Has a very high activation rate.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Tomebreaker]

Explanation: Increases Avoid by +50 if the enemy is equipped with a tome.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Sorcerer
Level: 15

Good for characters with poor Resistance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Slow Burn]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +1 per turn, up to a maximum of
+15 Hit Rate/Avoid.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dark Knight
Level: 5

Not nearly as useful as Quick Burn due to the average number of turns needed to
complete a battle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Lifetaker]

Explanation: Recover 50% of maximum HP after defeating an enemy on the user's
turn.

Activation: Defeat an enemy on the user's turn.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dark Knight
Level: 15

Absolutely fantastic if combined with Lifetaker. Very good for killing those
annoying enemies who have Counter if you can't OHKO them. However, it only
heals on your own turn, so in many cases Sol is a better option for self-heals.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Miracle]

Explanation: When hit with an attack that would otherwise KO them, the user
survives with 1 HP remaining. Must have more than 1 HP to activate.

Activation: (Luck stat)%

Learned By
----------
Class: Priest, Cleric
Level: 1

A good skill for characters with high luck, if you want to deal with the major
pain that is leveling through 10 levels of Priest or Cleric.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Healtouch]

Explanation: Increases HP healed by +5 when healing an ally with a stave.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Priest, Cleric
Level: 10

Very useful skill for your designated healing units, especially in the early
game when their magic stat sucks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Luck]

Explanation: Increases Luck for all allies by +8 within a 3 space radius. Lasts
until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: War Monk, War Cleric
Level: 5

One of the more useless of the various Rally skills. Replace it when possible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Renewal]

Explanation: User recovers 30% of their maximum HP at the start of their turn.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: War Monk, War Cleric
Level: 15

A very reliable recovery skill, but not capable of recovering as quickly as Sol
or Lifetaker. Good for characters who cannot get either of those, however.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Resistance +2]

Explanation: Increases Resistance stat by +2.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Troubadour
Level: 1

Another fairly lousy stat-boosting skill. Replace it.

[Demoiselle]

Explanation: Increases Avoid and Critical Avoid by +10 for all male allies
within a 3 space radius.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------

the survivability of your front-line units.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Resistance]

Explanation: Increases Resistance stat for all allies by +4 within a 3 space
radius. Lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Valkyrie
Level: 5

I'm getting really tired of writing the same thing for most of these Rally
skills. This one is like most of the others: situationally useful, but mediocre
overall.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Dual Support+]

Explanation: Increases support rank bonuses by 4 levels.*

*See fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Dual_System#Dual_Support for more details.

Activation: When paired up or supported.

Learned By
----------
Class: Valkyrie
Level: 15

A very useful skill if you like to take advantage of the support and pairing up
systems (Which you should). Use it if available. This, Dual Strike+, and Dual
Guard+ are essential for higher difficulties and end/postgame content.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Aptitude]

Explanation: Increases all growth rates by 20%.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Villager
Level: 1

An extremely useful skill for training. Unfortunately, it is limited to Donnel
and his child.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Underdog]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +15 when the user's level is lower
than the enemy. Promoted units are calculated as current level +20.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Villager
Level: 15

Useful for training Donnel since he starts off so slow, but not good for much
else. Replace it when you get the chance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Luck +4]

Explanation: Increases Luck stat by +4.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dancer
Level: 1

A stat-boosting skill unique to the Dancer class. However, Olivia should always
pass down Galeforce to her son Inigo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Special Dance]

Explanation: Increases Strength, Magic, Defence, and Resistance by +2 for the
unit who receives the user's dance. Lasts until the beginning of your next
turn.

Activation: Dance.

Learned By

A skill unique to Olivia. It makes her Dance command slightly more useful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Even Rythm]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +10 during even-numbered turns.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Taguel
Level: 1

Better than nothing, given the limited options available to most Taguel
characters. However, my opinion is that Taguels are mostly useless anyway...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Beastbane]

Explanation: Deals super-effective damage to beast (horse icon) units when the
user is in Taguel form.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Taguel
Level: 15

The one saving grace of the Taguel class. Definitely use it if you plan to use
Panne or Yarne.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Odd Rythm]

Explanation: Increases Hit Rate and Avoid by +10 during odd-numbered turns.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Manakete

[Wyrmsbane]

Explanation: Deals super-effective damage to dragon (dragon icon) units when
the user is in Manakete form.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Manakete
Level: 15

Gives Nowi, Nah, and Tiki an extra niche as Wyvern killers. Use it on maps
where there are lots of Wyvern enemies, and against Grima if you want.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Shadowgift]

Explanation: Enables usage of Dark tomes for tome-wielders who are not in the
Sorcerer or Dark Mage class.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Aversa
Level: N/A

A skill unique to Aversa and Morgan as Aversa's daughter, this skill is pretty
good. It allows them to use Nosferatu and other Dark tomes while still taking
advantage of the increased mobility of mounted classes. More desireable than
some other skills (as far as inheritance goes) simply because it's so hard to
get.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Conquest]

Explanation: Negates user's beast (horse icon) and armour (knight icon) type
weaknesses.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Conquerer

in certain situations.

[Resistance +10]

Explanation: Increases Resistance stat by +10.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dread Fighter
Level: 1

The first stat-boosting skill (other than Movement +1) that's actually good.
This skill can do wonders for characters who struggle from poor resistance, or
put it on a character with high resistance to make them into a fantastic mage-
killer. Obtained by using the Dread Scroll item, which is obtainable through
the Lost Bloodlines 2 DLC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Aggressor]

Explanation: Increases Attack by +10 during the user's turn.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: Dread Fighter
Level: 15

Fantastic when combined with Galeforce, Luna, or Lifetaker. Any male characters
who are used offensively should consider getting this. Obtainable by using the
Dread Scroll item, which is obtainable through the Lost Bloodlines 2 DLC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rally Heart]

Explanation: Increases Movement by +1 and all other stats by +2 for all allies
within a 3 space radius. Lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

Activation: Command

Learned By
----------
Class: Bride
Level: 1

The other Rally skill that doesn't suck (the other being Rally Spectrum). The
added movement is nice, too. Use it if you want. The Bride class is obtained by

2 DLC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Bond]

Explanation: Restores 10 HP to all allies within a 3 space radius at the
beginning of the user's turn.

[All Stats +2]

Explanation: Increases all stats, except Movement, by +2.

Activation: Always on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Paragon]

Explanation: Increases EXP gained by 200%.

Activation: Always on.

Learned By
----------
Class: DLC item
Level: N/A

Fantastic for level grinding, especially once your characters have switched
classes several times and are barely getting any EXP per kill. Obtainable
through the Lost Bloodlines 3 DLC.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)     [FAQ1]
===========================================

Q: What's the best way to raise my characters' levels?
A: Honestly, DLC grinding. EXPonential Growth and eventually Lost Bloodlines 3
are your best bets. If you don't want to spring for DLC, you can do a bunch of
Reeking Box encounters too, but they're not as effective.

Q: Oh, no! I just went into one of the Paralogue chapters to recruit a child
and realized that I forgot to put the right skills in the last skill slot! What
should I do?
A: This is why it is very important to inspect the recruitable children before
recruiting them. If you have not yet actually started the fight, simply go into
the menu and return to the world map. If you have started the fight, you can
perform a soft reset by pressing L + R + Start. Once you recruit the child and
save your game, you're stuck with whatever you have.

Q: When should I use a Master Seal or a Second Seal to switch classes?
A:The more levels a character has gained, the less EXP they will get, and the
longer it will take them to level up in their other classes. Your best bet is
to get the skills you want, and then move on to your next class as soon as
possible.

Q: When talking about growth rates, I see you say "50%". 50% of what?
A: It's not a percentage of something, but rather a probability. When I say a
character has 50% growth in, say... HP, it means that they have a 50% chance of
gaining +1 HP each time they level up.

Q: I don't want to do all this math to calculate my maximum stats! Isn't there
an easier way?
A: Well if you have access to the internet (and if you're readying this, you
obviously do), Serenesforest.net has a really nice maximum stat calculator. You
can just punch in the character, their class, and their parents (if applicable)
and it will pop out the maximum stats for you.

Q: Do I have to optimize my characters?
A: Of course not. You can play however you want. However, I find it to be one
of the most enjoyable aspects of this particular Fire Emblem title.

Q: I disagree with your assessment of so-and-so! What are you thinking?
A: As stated in the introduction, the content in this guide consists of my
opinions, which are based on facts and my experiences. However, they are also
based on my playstyle. Lastly, it is totally possibly for character results to
vary due to the nature of RNG stat growths.

Q: What do ORKO and OHKO mean?
A: ORKO is a one-round kill, it means you can kill an enemy within a single
round of combat (through multiple attacks in that round). OHKO is a one-hit
kill, meaning you can kill an enemy in a single strike.

Q: What qualifies you to write this?
A: I've played and beaten every Fire Emblem game released in America, as well
as an English translation of Fuuin no Tsurugi. As for Fire Emblem: Awakening, I
have beaten the game on Lunatic+ (after nearly destroying my 3DS from
repeatedly hurling it at the wall). I'm no expert, but I figured that I'm at
least mostly qualified to write a this guide. Honestly I was shocked that even
though the game has been out for a while, that no such guide was listed here.

Q: Who is your favorite character?
A: Well personality-wise, probably Tharja or Henry. Their dark sense of humor
amuses me. As far as sheer awesomeness in combat goes... Morgan as Aversa's
daughter, Nowi's Daughter, or Chrom's son is hard to beat.

Q: There's something in this guide I don't understand...
A: Make sure you read the applicable section of the guide in its entirety,
especially the notes at the beginning of the section and the introduction to
the guide as a whole. If you don't find the answer you're looking for, feel
free to contact me via email. Also, this guide has only been recently posted,
and is still undergoing revisions and additions. While it does function
currently as a standalone guide, there will be sections added in the future to
clarify some things (like what exactly a Nosferatu-tank is).

Q: How can I contact you with a question or correction?
A: See the contact information section below.
